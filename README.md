# ParTy-1.0
Parallel Corpus for Typology

This repository contains automatically aligned subtitles of films in different languages. The subtitles are aligned with the English version with the help of JÃ¶rg Tiedemann's software subalign. Some alignments have been manually checked, but this work is still in progress.

If you use these data in your research, please cite the following paper:

In addition, the folder "Originals" contains the original subtitles downloaded from opensubtitles.org in English, Chinese, Latvian and Lithuanian for specific projects.
