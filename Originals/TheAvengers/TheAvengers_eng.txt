00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:32,540
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

3
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:38,135
<i>It is on a little world,
a human world.</i>

4
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:41,927
<i>They would wield its power,</i>

5
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:48,224
<i>but our ally knows
its workings as they never will.</i>

6
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:52,559
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

7
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,660
<i>and our force,
our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

8
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:02,315
<i>A world will be his.</i>

9
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:05,752
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

10
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:12,011
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

12
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:26,988
<i>All personnel,</i>

13
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:29,574
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

14
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:33,309
<i>Proceed to your designated vehicles
for all chances of evacuation.</i>

15
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,610
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

16
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:37,398
<i>Emergency personnel.</i>

17
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,091
<i>Proceed to your designated vehicles
for all chances of evacuation.</i>

18
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,049
How bad is it?

19
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:06,034
That's the problem, sir.
We don't know.

20
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,236
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

21
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:15,237
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

22
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:17,608
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

23
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:18,822
Spontaneous event.

24
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:20,108
It just turned itself on?

25
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,360
Where are the energy levels now?

26
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,738
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

27
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:24,631
How long to get everyone out?

28
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,704
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

29
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:27,199
Do better.

30
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,086
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

31
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,673
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

32
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:35,089
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

33
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,627
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

34
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:38,794
I need you to make sure

35
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:40,591
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

36
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:42,806
Sir, is that really
a priority right now?

37
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:44,726
Until such time as the world ends,

38
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:47,137
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

39
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:49,345
Clear out the tech below.

40
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:51,996
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

41
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,412
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:54,938
With me.

43
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,450
Talk to me, doctor.

44
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:02,030
Director.

45
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:03,993
Is there anything
we know for certain?

46
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:06,405
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

47
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:09,140
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

48
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,092
The Tesseract is not only active,
she's... behaving.

49
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,715
- I assume you pulled the plug.
- She's an energy source.

50
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,043
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

51
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:20,802
If she reaches peak level...

52
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:24,432
We prepared for this, doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

53
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:27,593
We don't have the harness.
My calculations are far from complete.

54
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:30,302
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

55
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,638
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

56
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:34,938
That can be harmful.

57
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:36,605
Where's agent Barton?

58
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,458
The Hawk?

59
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,368
Up in his nest, as usual.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,920
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

61
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:46,912
I gave you this detail

62
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,408
so you could keep
a close eye on things.

63
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,211
Oh, I see better from a distance.

64
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:52,609
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

65
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,764
Doctor, it's spiking again.

66
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:58,347
No one's come or gone.
And Selvig's clean.

67
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,417
No contacts, no IMs.

68
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,586
If there was any tampering, sir,
it wasn't at this end.

69
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:06,462
"At this end"?

70
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:10,273
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,907
Doors open from both sides.

72
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,767
Not yet.

73
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:27,050
Sir, please put down the spear.

74
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,562
You have heart.

75
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:39,329
Please don't.

76
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,336
I still need that.

77
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:45,344
- This doesn't have to get any messier.
- Of course it does.

78
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,802
I've come too far
for anything else.

79
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,267
I am Loki, of Asgard

80
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:55,355
and I am burdened
with glorious purpose.

81
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,762
Loki...

82
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:58,768
brother of Thor.

83
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:01,263
We have no quarrel
with your people.

84
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,790
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

85
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:06,659
You planning to step on us?

86
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:13,488
I come with glad tidings...
of a world made free.

87
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:16,094
- Free from what?
- Freedom.

88
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:19,425
Freedom is life's great lie.

89
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:23,202
Once you accept that,
in your heart...

90
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,377
you will know peace.

91
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:31,579
Yeah, you say "peace",

92
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:34,350
I kinda think
you mean the other thing.

93
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,730
Sir, director Fury is stalling.

94
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:40,726
This place is about to blow
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

95
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,241
- He means to bury us.
- Like the pharaohs of old.

96
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,604
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

97
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:49,189
We got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

98
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,287
Well, then...

99
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,137
I need these vehicles.

100
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,669
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

101
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:17,480
<i>Hill!</i>

102
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:19,275
Do you copy?

103
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,805
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

104
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,068
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

105
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:16,530
Okay, let's go.
No, no, no, leave it. Leave it. Go!

106
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:34,586
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

107
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,898
<i>Director?</i>

108
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:10,054
Director Fury, do you copy?

109
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,276
The Tesseract is
with a hostile force.

110
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,785
I have men down. Hill?

111
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,761
A lot o' men still under.

112
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:19,145
I don't know
how many survivors.

113
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,148
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

114
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,117
<i>I want every living soul
not working rescue</i>

115
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,547
looking for that briefcase.

116
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:24,792
Roger that.

117
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:27,986
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

118
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,492
<i>As of right now,</i>

119
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,828
we are at war.

120
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,636
What do we do?

121
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:23,167
... you may have to write it down.

122
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:41,056
<i>You're at 1- 14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

123
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,442
<i>We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.</i>

124
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,279
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

125
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,111
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

126
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,122
<i>- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working.</i>

127
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:58,616
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

128
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,461
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

129
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,422
This moron is giving me everything.

130
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,462
I don't give everything.

131
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,262
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

132
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:08,901
<i>Natasha...</i>

133
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:12,488
Barton's been compromised.

134
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,432
Let me put you on hold.

135
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,269
Where is Barton now?

136
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,936
<i>- We don't know.
- But he's alive?</i>

137
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,939
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

138
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,236
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

139
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,533
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

140
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,320
Oh, I've got Stark.
You get the big guy.

141
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,284
You're a doctor.

142
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:03,905
Please.

143
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,323
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

144
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:34,817
You know, for a man

145
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,236
who's supposed
to be avoiding stress

146
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,775
you picked
a... hell of a place to settle.

147
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,630
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

148
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:45,776
Then what is it? Yoga?

149
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:50,059
You brought me to
the edge of the city. Smart.

150
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:54,523
I, uh, assume the whole place
is surrounded.

151
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,185
Just you and me.

152
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:00,288
And your actress buddy?

153
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,647
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

154
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,312
I did.

155
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:07,039
- Who are you?
- Natasha Romanoff.

156
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,570
Are you here to kill me,
Ms. Romanoff?

157
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:14,092
Because that's not gonna
work out for everyone.

158
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:17,282
No, no, course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

159
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:20,027
S.H.I.E.L.D...

160
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,555
- How did they find me?
- We never lost you, doctor.

161
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:26,033
We've kept our distance.

162
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,978
Even helped keep
some other interested parties

163
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:29,398
off your scent.

164
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:32,876
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.

165
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,265
But now we need you to come in.

166
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:39,876
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.

167
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:46,571
And what if the... other guy says no?

168
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,238
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

169
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:51,675
I don't think you wanna
break that streak.

170
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,589
Well, I don't every time
get what I want.

171
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,336
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

172
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:04,080
All those I...
actively try to avoid.

173
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:05,258
This...

174
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,304
is the Tesseract.

175
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,809
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

176
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:17,049
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

177
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:20,079
He wants you to find it.
It's been taken.

178
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:24,278
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

179
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:27,840
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

180
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,966
If there was, that's where I'd be.

181
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,088
- So, Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.

182
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,881
And he tells you everything?

183
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,498
Talk to Fury.
He needs you on this.

184
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,656
He needs me in a cage?

185
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:41,788
No one's gonna put you in a...

186
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,956
Stop lying to me!

187
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,361
I'm sorry. That was mean.

188
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,460
I just wanted to see
what you'd do.

189
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,094
Why don't we...
do this the easy way

190
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,554
where you don't use that

191
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:02,706
and the... other guy
doesn't make a mess.

192
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:04,763
Okay?

193
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:07,105
Natasha?

194
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,121
Stand down.

195
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,997
<i>We're good here.</i>

196
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:19,623
Just you and me.

197
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:24,172
<i>This is outa line, director.</i>

198
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:27,145
<i>You're dealing
with forces you can't control.</i>

199
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,818
You ever been in a war,
councilman? In a fire fight?

200
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:33,910
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

201
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:37,550
<i>You're saying that this... Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

202
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:40,192
Not Asgard. Loki.

203
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,147
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

204
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,471
<i>His brother.</i>

205
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,451
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile,

206
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:47,856
but he's worlds away.

207
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,738
We can't depend on him
to help, either.

208
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:50,943
It's up to us.

209
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,694
<i>Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

210
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,148
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

211
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:58,536
Phase 2 isn't ready.
Our enemy is.

212
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,331
We need a response team.

213
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,830
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

214
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:04,588
This isn't about the Avengers.

215
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:05,808
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

216
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,587
<i>You're running the world's
greatest covert security network</i>

217
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:10,341
<i>and you're gonna leave
the fate of the human race</i>

218
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,755
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

219
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:13,795
I'm not leaving anything
to anyone.

220
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,938
We need a response team.

221
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:19,017
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even,

222
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:23,273
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

223
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,109
<i>You believe?</i>

224
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,468
<i>War isn't won by sentiment,
director.</i>

225
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:32,748
No, it's won by soldiers.

226
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:53,718
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

227
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:56,361
<i>I gotta put her in the water!</i>

228
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,593
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

229
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:04,243
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

230
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:06,668
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

231
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,525
Trouble sleeping?

232
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:36,848
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

233
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:42,306
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

234
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:50,817
When I went under,
the world was at war.

235
00:21:51,196 --> 00:21:52,945
I wake up,
they say we won.

236
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,323
They didn't say what we lost.

237
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,169
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

238
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,257
Some, very recently.

239
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,639
- You're here with a mission, sir?
- I am.

240
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:07,293
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.

241
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:14,509
HYDRA's secret weapon.

242
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:17,088
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

243
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:18,388
when he was looking for you.

244
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,479
He thought what we think.

245
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:24,938
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

246
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:28,533
That's something
the world sorely needs.

247
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:33,329
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.

248
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,238
He's... not from around here.

249
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:39,799
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up
to speed on if you're in.

250
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:44,593
The world has gotten even stranger
than you already know.

251
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:47,124
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

252
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,790
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

253
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,716
There's a debriefing packet
waiting for you back at your apartment.

254
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,364
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

255
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:01,067
that we ought to know now?

256
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,349
You should have left it in the ocean.

257
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:39,144
<i>Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.</i>

258
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:40,802
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

259
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:41,759
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

260
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,686
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.

261
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:48,020
<i>Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over</i>

262
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:49,115
<i>and it actually works.</i>

263
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:50,780
<i>I assume.</i>

264
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:52,247
Light 'er up.

265
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,072
<i>How does it look?</i>

266
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:01,961
Like Christmas, but with more... me.

267
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,866
<i>We gotta go wider
on the public awareness campaign.</i>

268
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:05,114
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

269
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,419
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

270
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,256
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

271
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:10,703
<i>Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?</i>

272
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:12,038
<i> - Enjoy the moment.
- Get in here and I will.</i>

273
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:19,680
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.</i>

274
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,117
<i>I'm not in.</i>

275
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,215
I'm actually out.

276
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,810
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

277
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,881
Grow a spine, Jarvis.
I got a date.

278
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:43,412
Levels are holding steady...
I think.

279
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:45,907
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

280
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:49,248
Which brings me to my next question.
How does it feel to be a genius?

281
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:51,871
Well, huh, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

282
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,898
What do you mean?
All this came... from you.

283
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:59,762
No, all this came from that.

284
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,777
Give yourself some credit. Please.

285
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:07,693
Stark Tower is your baby.
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

286
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:10,198
- 12%?
- An argument can be made for 15.

287
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:13,786
- 12%? My baby?
- Well, I did do all the... heavy lifting.

288
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:18,359
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

289
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:19,864
- That was on you.
- Ohh...

290
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,862
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

291
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:24,620
Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

292
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,616
I'm gonna pay for that...
comment about percentages

293
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:29,792
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

294
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:32,088
- It's not gonna be that subtle.
- I'll tell you what.

295
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:35,630
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

296
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:37,227
On the lease.

297
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,927
Call your mom.
Can you bunk over?

298
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:41,591
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

299
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:44,147
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

300
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:45,642
<i>Mr. Stark, we need to talk.</i>

301
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:49,096
You have reached
the life model decoy of Tony Stark.

302
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,070
- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.

303
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,645
Then leave it urgently.

304
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:55,977
Security breach. It's on you.

305
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:58,902
- Mr. Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

306
00:25:59,075 --> 00:25:59,334
"Phil"?

307
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:00,543
I can't stay.

308
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,659
Uh... His first name is "Agent".

309
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:05,780
- Come on in. We're celebrating.
- Which is why he can't stay.

310
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,666
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

311
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:09,908
I don't like being handed things.

312
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:11,587
That's fine, cause
I love to be handed things.

313
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:13,139
So, let's trade.

314
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:15,929
Thank you.

315
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:19,251
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

316
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:20,277
every other Thursday.

317
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:22,935
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about the Avengers?

318
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,324
Which I-I know nothing about.

319
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,099
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

320
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:29,689
And I didn't even qualify.

321
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:30,658
I didn't know that either.

322
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,937
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile,
self-obsessed,

323
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,485
don't play well with others...

324
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:36,244
That I did know.

325
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:38,364
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

326
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:41,993
- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a second?
- Half a mo.

327
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,700
You know, I thought
we were having a moment.

328
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,794
I was having 12% of a moment.

329
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:55,169
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

330
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,340
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

331
00:26:57,552 --> 00:26:59,010
What is all this?

332
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:01,055
This is, uh...

333
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:02,794
this.

334
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,478
- I'm gonna take the jet to DC tonight.
- Tomorrow.

335
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:15,065
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

336
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,810
Well, what if I... didn't?

337
00:27:17,614 --> 00:27:18,990
- If you didn't?
- Yeah.

338
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,545
You mean, when you've finished?

339
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:25,738
Well... um, then...

340
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,242
Square deal. Fly safe.

341
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:37,582
Work hard.

342
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,215
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

343
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,671
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

344
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,011
Well, I wanna hear about that cellist.
Is that still a thing?

345
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:52,144
- She moved back to Portland.
- What?! Boo!

346
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,915
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

347
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:10,533
So, this dr. Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

348
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,032
A lot o' people were.

349
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:14,199
You were the world's first superhero.

350
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:17,628
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

351
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:19,227
Erskine's original formula.

352
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:22,876
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.

353
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,476
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a... Stephen Hawking.

354
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,927
He's like a... smart person.

355
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:33,942
I gotta say,

356
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:37,234
it's an honour to meet you... officially.

357
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,025
I sort of met you, I mean...

358
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,537
I watched you
while you were sleeping.

359
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,480
I mean, I was...
I was present

360
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,823
while you were
unconscious... from the... ice.

361
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,176
You know, it's really... it's just a...
just a huge honor

362
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:52,882
to have you on board... this...

363
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:58,091
- I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.

364
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:01,368
Uh, we made some modifications
to the uniform.

365
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:04,662
- I had a little design input.
- Uniform?

366
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:07,716
Aren't the stars and stripes a little...

367
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:10,198
old-fashioned?

368
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:13,223
With everything that's happening

369
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,066
and the things that are about
to come to light,

370
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:19,396
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

371
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,683
The Chitauri grow restless.

372
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:56,661
Let them gird themselves.

373
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,736
I will lead them
in the glorious battle.

374
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,101
Battle?

375
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:04,018
Against the... meagre might of Earth?

376
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,981
Glorious, not lengthy.

377
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:11,073
If your force is
as formidable as you claim.

378
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:13,278
You question us?

379
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:15,824
You question him...

380
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,594
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

381
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:21,706
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

382
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:24,966
when you were cast out, defeated?

383
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:26,544
I was a king!

384
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,959
The rightful king of Asgard...

385
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:30,974
betrayed.

386
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:36,861
Your ambition is little...
and born of childish need.

387
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,437
We look beyond the Earth

388
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,955
to greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

389
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,776
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

390
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,779
I don't threaten.

391
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:51,920
But until I open the doors,

392
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:55,794
until your force is mine
to command,

393
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:58,330
you are but words.

394
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:02,622
You will have your war, Asgardian.

395
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:06,894
If you fail,

396
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:11,964
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

397
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:16,595
there will be no realm,
no barren moon,

398
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,279
no crevice where he cannot find you.

399
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:24,575
You think you know pain?

400
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:31,149
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

401
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,058
- Stow the captain's gear.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:06,313
Agent Romanoff... captain Rogers.

403
00:32:06,703 --> 00:32:08,055
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

404
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:10,477
They need you on the bridge.
They're starting the face-trace.

405
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,246
See you there.

406
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:17,319
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

407
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:20,216
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

408
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:23,921
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

409
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:27,727
- Trading cards?
- They're vintage. He's very proud.

410
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:30,498
Dr. Banner!

411
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,926
Oh, yeah, hi.

412
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:37,059
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the Cube.

413
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,970
- Is that the... only word on me?
- Only word I care about.

414
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,651
Must be strange for you,
all of this.

415
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:50,108
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

416
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:53,166
Gentlemen, you might wanna
step inside in a minute.

417
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,399
It's... gonna get a little hard to breathe.

418
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,163
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

419
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:05,005
Is this a submarine?

420
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:06,550
Really?

421
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,912
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

422
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,653
No, no, this is much worse.

423
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:11,741
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

424
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:14,318
Increase collective to 8.0%.

425
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,693
Preparing for
maximum performance takeoff.

426
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,158
Increase output to capacity.

427
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:25,296
Power plant performing at capacity.

428
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:27,117
We are clear.

429
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,973
All engines operating.

430
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:33,667
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

431
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,243
- We're at level, sir.
- Good.

432
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:40,311
- Let's vanish.
- Engage retro-reflection panels.

433
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,688
Reflection panels engaged.

434
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,156
Gentlemen.

435
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,326
Doctor, thank you for coming.

436
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:19,684
Thanks for asking nicely.
So, uh, how long am I staying?

437
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:21,628
Once we get our hands
on the Tesseract,

438
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:22,972
you're in the wind.

439
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:24,424
Where are you with that?

440
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,437
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible
camera on the planet.

441
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:30,596
Cell phones, laptops...

442
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:33,927
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

443
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,535
That's still not gonna
find them in time.

444
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:36,770
You have to narrow your field.

445
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:39,042
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

446
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:41,024
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

447
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:42,692
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

448
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,563
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

449
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:47,819
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

450
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:50,418
At least we could rule out
a few places.

451
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,618
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

452
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,133
Agent Romanoff,

453
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,204
could you show dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

454
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,931
You're gonna love it, doc.
We got all the toys.

455
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:01,837
Put it over there.

456
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,229
Where did you find all these people?

457
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,148
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, doctor.

458
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:10,801
This the stuff you need?

459
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:12,283
Yeah, iridium.

460
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,189
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

461
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:16,810
It's very hard to get hold of.

462
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:18,668
Especially if
S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

463
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:20,253
Well, I didn't know.

464
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:21,366
Hey!

465
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:23,958
The Tesseract has shown me so much.
It's...

466
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:27,173
- It's more than knowledge. It's truth.
- I know.

467
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:30,445
What did it show you, agent Barton?

468
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:34,167
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.

469
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,881
I need a distraction.

470
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,679
And an eyeball.

471
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:50,924
I mean,
if it's not too much trouble.

472
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:52,721
No, no, it's fine.

473
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:56,766
It's a vintage set.

474
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,331
Took me a couple o' years
to collect them all.

475
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,960
Near mint.

476
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:04,549
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

477
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:07,380
We got a hit. A 67% match.

478
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:09,880
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

479
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:11,510
Location?

480
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:14,658
Stuttgart, Germany.
28 Königstrasse.

481
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,181
He's not exactly hiding.

482
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:17,207
Captain...

483
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,215
you're up.

484
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,072
Kneel before me.

485
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,260
I said...

486
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,584
kneel!!!

487
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:17,783
Is not this... simpler?

488
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,637
Is this not your natural state?

489
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,114
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

490
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,185
that you crave subjugation.

491
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,380
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

492
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,507
in a mad scramble for power...

493
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,532
for identity...

494
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,748
You were made to be ruled.

495
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,748
In the end,
you will always kneel.

496
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,842
Not to men like you.

497
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,514
There are no men like me.

498
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,242
There are always men like you.

499
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,432
Look to your elder, people.

500
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,453
Let him be an example.

501
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:23,073
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

502
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,497
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

503
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,445
we ended up disagreeing.

504
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,178
The soldier.

505
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:34,220
The man out of time.

506
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,923
I'm not the one
who's out of time.

507
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:42,259
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

508
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,485
Kneel.

509
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:05,079
Not today!

510
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,920
The guy's all over the place.

511
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,681
<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>

512
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,327
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

513
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:42,654
<i>Good move.</i>

514
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:45,710
Mr. Stark.

515
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,386
<i>Captain.</i>

516
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,104
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

517
00:42:56,494 --> 00:42:57,762
Not a word.

518
00:42:58,037 --> 00:43:00,379
<i>Just get him here.
We're low on time.</i>

519
00:43:03,234 --> 00:43:04,040
I don't like it.

520
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,335
What? Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

521
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:08,085
I don't remember it
being that easy.

522
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:09,840
This guy packs a wallop.

523
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,993
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

524
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,179
What's your thing, Pilates?

525
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:18,368
- What?
- It's like calisthenics.

526
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,065
You might have missed
a couple things, you know,

527
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,657
doing time as a capsicle.

528
00:43:24,523 --> 00:43:26,006
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

529
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:28,609
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

530
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,826
Where is this comin' from?

531
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,439
What's the matter?
Scared of a little lightning?

532
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,794
I'm not overly fond
of what follows.

533
00:43:58,349 --> 00:43:59,326
What are you doing?

534
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,783
<i>And now there's that guy.</i>

535
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:15,329
Another Asgardian?

536
00:44:16,076 --> 00:44:17,723
- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

537
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:20,693
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

538
00:44:20,914 --> 00:44:22,749
Stark!
We need a plan of attack!

539
00:44:22,749 --> 00:44:25,223
<i>I have a plan. Attack!</i>

540
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:32,974
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

541
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,256
I don't see how I can.

542
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,186
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

543
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:38,893
There's only one God, ma'am.

544
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:41,083
And I'm pretty sure
He doesn't dress like that.

545
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:59,715
- Where is the Tesseract?
- I missed you, too.

546
00:44:59,912 --> 00:45:01,581
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

547
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,665
You should thank me.

548
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,165
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

549
00:45:06,377 --> 00:45:09,129
did the All-father have
to muster to conjure you here,

550
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,714
your precious Earth?

551
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,125
I thought you dead.

552
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:19,175
Did you mourn?

553
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:21,432
We all did. Our father...

554
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:24,164
Your... father.

555
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:29,118
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

556
00:45:31,987 --> 00:45:33,912
We were raised together.

557
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:37,046
We played together,
we fought together.

558
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:40,331
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadow.

559
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:45,192
Living in the shade of your greatness.

560
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,831
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

561
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:50,955
I, who was, and should be, king!

562
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:53,249
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

563
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,172
for your imagined slights?

564
00:45:55,428 --> 00:45:58,635
No. The Earth is
under my protection, Loki.

565
00:45:59,932 --> 00:46:03,467
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

566
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:05,894
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

567
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,813
while you idly fret.

568
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:10,182
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

569
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:11,944
You think yourself above them?

570
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:14,025
Well, yes.

571
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,162
Then you miss
the truth of ruling, brother.

572
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:18,909
A throne would suit you ill.

573
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:26,480
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

574
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:31,249
I have grown, Odin son, in my exile.

575
00:46:31,632 --> 00:46:33,589
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

576
00:46:33,717 --> 00:46:34,796
and when I wield it...

577
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,605
Who showed you this power?

578
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,258
Who controls the would-be king?

579
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:41,264
- I am a king!
- Not here!

580
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:44,494
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!

581
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:49,524
You come home.

582
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:56,071
I don't have it.

583
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,491
You need the Cube to bring me home.

584
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,849
But I've sent it off,
I know not where.

585
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:04,847
You listen well, brother.

586
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:08,077
I'm listening.

587
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,681
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.

588
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,132
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

589
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,352
Uhh... Shakespeare in the Park?

590
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:30,517
Doth Mother know
you weareth her drapes?

591
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:33,444
This is beyond you, metal man.

592
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:35,860
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

593
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:38,990
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then...

594
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:41,007
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

595
00:47:42,621 --> 00:47:43,784
<i>Tourist.</i>

596
00:47:49,628 --> 00:47:50,687
Okay.

597
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:23,112
<i>Power at 400% capacity.</i>

598
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,757
How about that?

599
00:49:25,435 --> 00:49:26,278
Hey!

600
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:30,387
That's enough!

601
00:49:34,277 --> 00:49:35,525
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

602
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,362
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

603
00:49:38,362 --> 00:49:41,237
Then prove it.
Put that hammer down.

604
00:49:41,368 --> 00:49:42,078
Uh, yeah... No.

605
00:49:42,078 --> 00:49:44,078
<i>Bad call.
He loves his hammer.</i>

606
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:47,409
You want me
to put the hammer down?

607
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,773
Are we done, here?

608
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,840
In case it's unclear...

609
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:09,968
You try to escape,

610
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:13,672
you so much as
scratch that glass...

611
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:27,566
30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

612
00:51:27,769 --> 00:51:29,429
You get how that works?

613
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,191
Ant... boot.

614
00:51:37,904 --> 00:51:39,648
It's an impressive cage.

615
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:42,648
Not built, I think, for me.

616
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:45,924
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

617
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:47,491
Oh, I've heard.

618
00:51:49,082 --> 00:51:50,577
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

619
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:53,081
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

620
00:51:53,962 --> 00:51:56,043
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

621
00:51:56,423 --> 00:51:59,385
<i>you call on
such lost creatures to defend you?</i>

622
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:01,708
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

623
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:04,054
You threaten my world with war.

624
00:52:04,264 --> 00:52:06,397
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

625
00:52:06,397 --> 00:52:09,592
You talk about peace,
and you kill cause it's fun.

626
00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:15,766
You have made me very desperate.
You might not be glad that you did.

627
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:21,879
Ohh... It burns you
to have come so close.

628
00:52:23,743 --> 00:52:26,448
To have the Tesseract,
to have power,

629
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:28,943
unlimited power.

630
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,074
And for what?

631
00:52:33,294 --> 00:52:35,914
A warm light for all mankind to share.

632
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,499
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

633
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:48,890
Well, let me know if
"real power" wants a magazine or something.

634
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:58,778
He really grows on you,
doesn't he?

635
00:52:58,987 --> 00:53:00,824
Loki's gonna drag this out.

636
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:04,566
So... Thor, what's his play?

637
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:07,216
He has an army called the Chitauri.

638
00:53:07,538 --> 00:53:10,090
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

639
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:12,951
He means to lead them
against your people.

640
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:14,599
They will win him the Earth,

641
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,670
in return, I suspect,
for the Tesseract.

642
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:17,830
An army...

643
00:53:18,841 --> 00:53:20,332
from outer space.

644
00:53:20,718 --> 00:53:22,524
So, he's building another portal.

645
00:53:23,346 --> 00:53:25,876
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?

646
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:28,274
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

647
00:53:28,274 --> 00:53:30,556
Loki has him
under some kind of spell...

648
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,266
along with one of ours.

649
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:34,050
I wanna know
why Loki let us take him.

650
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,512
He's not leading an army from here.

651
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:37,355
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

652
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:40,809
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.
Could smell crazy on him.

653
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,814
Have care how you speak.

654
00:53:43,366 --> 00:53:45,754
Loki is beyond reason
but he is of Asgard.

655
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:49,400
- And he is my brother.
- He killed 80 people in two days.

656
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,035
He's adopted.

657
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,910
I think it's about the mechanics.

658
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,667
Iridium... What do they need
the iridium for?

659
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:56,974
It's a stabilizing agent.

660
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,539
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.
I'll fly you to Portland.

661
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,380
Keep love alive.

662
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:03,842
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

663
00:54:04,012 --> 00:54:05,252
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

664
00:54:06,056 --> 00:54:08,969
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You got a mean swing.

665
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,650
Also, it means
the portal can open as wide

666
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,321
and stay open as long
as Loki wants.

667
00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:17,804
Uh, raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

668
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:20,452
That man is playing Galaga.

669
00:54:21,322 --> 00:54:24,059
He thought we wouldn't notice...
but we did.

670
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:28,987
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.

671
00:54:29,497 --> 00:54:30,836
Sounds exhausting.

672
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,405
The rest of the raw materials,

673
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:35,957
agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

674
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:37,795
The only major component
he still needs

675
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:41,618
is a power source...
of high-energy density.

676
00:54:41,885 --> 00:54:44,976
Somethin' to... kick-start the Cube.

677
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:48,332
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

678
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:49,591
Last night.

679
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:53,154
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers...

680
00:54:53,154 --> 00:54:54,319
Am I the only one
who did the reading?

681
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,844
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

682
00:54:57,609 --> 00:55:00,189
He'd have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

683
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:01,932
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

684
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:04,517
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

685
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:05,731
the quantum tunnelling effect.

686
00:55:05,951 --> 00:55:06,604
Well, if he could do that,

687
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:09,574
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

688
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:12,026
Finally.
Someone who speaks English.

689
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,759
Is that what just happened?

690
00:55:14,585 --> 00:55:16,196
It's good to meet you, dr. Banner.

691
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:19,849
Your work on
antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

692
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,826
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

693
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:24,246
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

694
00:55:25,638 --> 00:55:25,873
Thanks.

695
00:55:25,873 --> 00:55:29,095
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

696
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:30,805
I was hoping you might join 'im.

697
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,902
I'd start with that stick o' his.
It may be magical,

698
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:34,843
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

699
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:38,017
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

700
00:55:38,317 --> 00:55:40,067
And I'd like to know
how Loki used it

701
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,868
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

702
00:55:41,868 --> 00:55:43,891
into his personal flying monkeys.

703
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:45,699
Monkeys?
I do not understand.

704
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:46,399
I do.

705
00:55:49,697 --> 00:55:51,579
I... I understood that reference.

706
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:55,166
- Shall we play, doctor?
- This way, sir.

707
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,427
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

708
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:13,512
with Selvig's reports
of the Tesseract.

709
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:15,671
But it's gonna take weeks to process.

710
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:17,054
If we bypass their mainframe

711
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:18,383
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

712
00:56:18,383 --> 00:56:21,777
we can clock this
at around... 600 teraflops.

713
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:24,899
All I packed was a toothbrush.

714
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:27,569
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

715
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:31,616
Top ten floors, all R&D...
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

716
00:56:31,831 --> 00:56:33,570
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

717
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:37,128
I... kinda broke... Harlem.

718
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:39,152
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

719
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:41,202
No tension, no surprises...

720
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,034
- Hey!
- Nothin'?

721
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:46,159
- Are you nuts?
- Jury's out.

722
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:47,710
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

723
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:48,338
What's your secret?

724
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,301
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag o' weed?

725
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:52,811
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Funny things are.

726
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:54,888
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

727
00:56:55,021 --> 00:56:55,556
isn't funny.

728
00:56:56,398 --> 00:56:56,838
No offence, doc.

729
00:56:56,838 --> 00:56:58,688
Yeah, i-it's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

730
00:56:58,688 --> 00:57:01,176
if I couldn't handle... pointy things.

731
00:57:02,112 --> 00:57:04,532
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

732
00:57:04,532 --> 00:57:06,483
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

733
00:57:06,616 --> 00:57:07,554
You think I'm not?

734
00:57:08,243 --> 00:57:10,987
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

735
00:57:11,163 --> 00:57:12,355
What isn't he tellin' us?

736
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,148
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

737
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:16,547
You think
Fury's hiding something?

738
00:57:16,547 --> 00:57:19,841
He's a spy.
Captain, he's "the spy".

739
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,571
His secrets have secrets.

740
00:57:21,965 --> 00:57:23,291
It's buggin' him, too. Isn't it?

741
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:27,844
Uhh... I just wanna
finish my work here, and...

742
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:28,917
Doctor?

743
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:36,675
"A warm light for all mankind."

744
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:39,772
- Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.
- I heard it.

745
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:41,805
Well, I think
that was meant for you.

746
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:46,595
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki
about the tower,

747
00:57:46,595 --> 00:57:47,862
it was still all over the news.

748
00:57:47,992 --> 00:57:50,476
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly...

749
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:52,657
building in New York?

750
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:55,666
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

751
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:58,564
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

752
00:57:59,170 --> 00:57:59,963
It's just the prototype.

753
00:58:01,131 --> 00:58:03,199
I'm kinda the only name
in clean energy right now.

754
00:58:03,508 --> 00:58:04,238
That's what he's gettin' at.

755
00:58:04,238 --> 00:58:07,543
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D.
bring him in on the Tesseract project?

756
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:10,829
I mean, what are they doing
in the energy business in the first place?

757
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,916
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

758
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,541
finishes breaking into
all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

759
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,475
I'm sorry. Did you say...?

760
00:58:17,606 --> 00:58:19,598
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

761
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:21,311
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

762
00:58:21,443 --> 00:58:22,606
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

763
00:58:22,736 --> 00:58:23,215
Blueberry?

764
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:25,512
Yet, you're confused about
why they didn't want you around.

765
00:58:25,512 --> 00:58:28,699
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

766
00:58:28,826 --> 00:58:30,403
Historically, not awesome.

767
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:32,409
I think
Loki's trying to wind us up.

768
00:58:32,955 --> 00:58:34,447
This is a man
who means to start a war

769
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:36,490
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

770
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:40,149
We have orders.
We should follow them.

771
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:42,150
Following's not really my style.

772
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:45,587
And you're all about style,
aren't you?

773
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:46,922
Of the people in this room,

774
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,825
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

775
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,383
and, B, not of use?

776
00:58:50,515 --> 00:58:54,997
Steve... Tell me none o' this
smells a little funky to you.

777
00:58:57,563 --> 00:58:59,105
Just find the Cube.

778
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:13,366
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

779
00:59:13,914 --> 00:59:15,914
Wondering if they shouldn't
have kept 'im on ice.

780
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:20,755
The guy's not wrong about Loki.
He does have the jump on us.

781
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:23,866
What he's got
is an ACME dynamite kit.

782
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:25,869
It's gonna blow up in his face.

783
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:27,946
And... I'm gonna be there when it does.

784
00:59:28,637 --> 00:59:30,581
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

785
00:59:31,997 --> 00:59:34,388
Mm-hm. Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

786
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:38,868
Uh, you see...
I don't get a suit of armor.

787
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:44,190
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.
It's a nightmare.

788
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:47,649
You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

789
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:49,429
to crawl its way into my heart.

790
00:59:49,909 --> 00:59:51,108
This stops it.

791
00:59:52,078 --> 00:59:54,515
This little circle o' light,
it's part of me now...

792
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:56,531
not just armor.

793
00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:00,154
It's a terrible... privilege.

794
01:00:00,629 --> 01:00:03,126
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

795
01:00:03,256 --> 01:00:04,252
It's different.

796
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,486
Hey... I read
all about your accident.

797
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:10,816
That much gamma exposure...
should've killed you.

798
01:00:11,514 --> 01:00:13,462
So, you're saying that the Hulk...

799
01:00:15,435 --> 01:00:17,678
The other guy saved my life?

800
01:00:18,313 --> 01:00:19,619
That's nice.

801
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:23,689
It's a nice sentiment.
Saved it for... what?

802
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:26,798
I guess we'll find out.

803
01:00:29,032 --> 01:00:31,719
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.

804
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:34,759
As soon as Loki took the doctor,
we moved Jane Foster.

805
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:37,621
They got
an excellent observatory in Troms, so...

806
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:40,728
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

807
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:44,958
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

808
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:47,587
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.

809
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,677
It's no accident
Loki taking Erik Selvig.

810
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:55,802
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

811
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,977
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.

812
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:01,905
You changed his life.

813
01:02:04,172 --> 01:02:05,836
You changed everything around here.

814
01:02:06,174 --> 01:02:07,871
They were better as they were.

815
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:10,863
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

816
01:02:10,863 --> 01:02:14,454
but we... we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

817
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:16,614
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

818
01:02:16,614 --> 01:02:19,662
You know,
huge, scaly, big antlers...

819
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,050
- You don't have those?
- Don't think so.

820
01:02:22,649 --> 01:02:24,116
Well, they are repulsive.

821
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,021
They trample everything
in their path.

822
01:02:35,787 --> 01:02:39,121
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

823
01:02:39,249 --> 01:02:41,261
and your people paid the price.

824
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,153
And now, again.

825
01:02:46,048 --> 01:02:48,046
In my youth, I courted war.

826
01:02:50,261 --> 01:02:52,165
War hasn't started yet.

827
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:55,076
You think
you could make Loki tell us

828
01:02:55,076 --> 01:02:56,156
where the Tesseract is?

829
01:02:56,452 --> 01:02:59,976
I do not know.
Loki's mind is far afield.

830
01:03:00,104 --> 01:03:03,894
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

831
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:07,188
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

832
01:03:08,154 --> 01:03:09,878
A lot o' guys think that...

833
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,083
until the pain starts.

834
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:15,344
What are you asking me to do?

835
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:19,317
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

836
01:03:19,317 --> 01:03:20,655
Loki is a prisoner.

837
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:23,072
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

838
01:03:23,072 --> 01:03:25,006
that wants to be here?

839
01:03:37,434 --> 01:03:40,350
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

840
01:03:40,646 --> 01:03:42,306
But you figured I'd come.

841
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:44,346
After.

842
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:48,426
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

843
01:03:48,987 --> 01:03:52,402
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

844
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:54,963
And I would cooperate.

845
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:57,400
I wanna know what
you've done to agent Barton.

846
01:03:57,538 --> 01:03:59,890
I'd say I've expanded his mind.

847
01:04:02,126 --> 01:04:03,618
And once you've won,

848
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,201
once you're king of the mountain...

849
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:10,565
what happens to his mind?

850
01:04:12,094 --> 01:04:13,886
Is this love, agent Romanoff?

851
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:16,992
Love is for children.
I owe him a debt.

852
01:04:20,728 --> 01:04:22,033
Tell me.

853
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:29,744
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D...
I, uh...

854
01:04:32,616 --> 01:04:35,965
Well... I made a name for myself.

855
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:39,174
I have a very specific skill set.

856
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:43,412
I didn't care
who I used it for... or on.

857
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:47,059
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

858
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:51,321
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

859
01:04:53,095 --> 01:04:54,783
He made a different call.

860
01:04:56,598 --> 01:04:59,551
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

861
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:02,698
- Not let you out.
- Now, there, but I like this.

862
01:05:04,273 --> 01:05:07,712
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

863
01:05:07,712 --> 01:05:09,665
Regimes fall every day.

864
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:12,301
I tend not to weep over that,
I'm Russian.

865
01:05:12,698 --> 01:05:14,019
Or I was.

866
01:05:14,992 --> 01:05:16,652
And what are you now?

867
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,226
It's really not that complicated.

868
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:23,860
I got red in my ledger...
I'd like to wipe it out.

869
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:26,639
Can you?

870
01:05:28,173 --> 01:05:31,328
Can you wipe out that much red?

871
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:34,690
Dreykov's daughter...

872
01:05:36,348 --> 01:05:36,901
São Paulo...

873
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,279
the hospital fire?

874
01:05:42,562 --> 01:05:44,699
Barton told me everything.

875
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:47,947
Your ledger is dripping.
It's gushing red

876
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:50,620
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

877
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,165
will change anything?

878
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:58,963
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child at prayer. Pathetic!

879
01:05:59,663 --> 01:06:01,975
<i>You lie and kill...</i>

880
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:05,411
<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>

881
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,524
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

882
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,952
<i>something that makes up
for the horrors.</i>

883
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,362
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

884
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,409
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

885
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,833
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

886
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:30,843
Slowly, intimately,
in every way he knows you fear.

887
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,958
And then he'll wake just
long enough to see his good work

888
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,979
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

889
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,636
This is my bargain,
you mewling quim.

890
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,060
You're a monster.

891
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,811
Oh, no.

892
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:50,375
You brought the monster.

893
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,785
So, Banner.

894
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,175
That's your play.

895
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,337
What?

896
01:06:59,108 --> 01:07:00,372
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

897
01:07:00,372 --> 01:07:03,717
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way. Send Thor as well.

898
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:08,507
Thank you...
for your cooperation.

899
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:17,935
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

900
01:07:17,935 --> 01:07:20,569
Uh, kinda been wonderin'
the same thing about you.

901
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,469
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

902
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:23,795
We are. The model's locked

903
01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:25,486
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

904
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:26,508
When we get a hit,

905
01:07:26,678 --> 01:07:28,882
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

906
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:32,190
Yeah, then you get
your Cube back. No muss... no fuss...

907
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:34,827
What is "Phase 2"?

908
01:07:36,846 --> 01:07:39,480
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

909
01:07:39,808 --> 01:07:41,551
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

910
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:44,234
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

911
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,071
- This does not mean that we're making...
- I'm sorry, Nick.

912
01:07:47,232 --> 01:07:48,290
What were you lyin'?

913
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:51,931
I was wrong, director.
The world hasn't changed a bit.

914
01:07:51,931 --> 01:07:52,867
Did you know about this?

915
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:54,496
You wanna think about
removing yourself

916
01:07:54,496 --> 01:07:56,007
from this environment, doctor?

917
01:07:56,007 --> 01:07:58,147
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

918
01:07:58,147 --> 01:08:00,880
- Loki is manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what, exactly?

919
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,020
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

920
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:03,879
Yes, and I'm not leaving

921
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,515
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

922
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,808
I'd like to know why
S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract

923
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:10,901
to build weapons of mass destruction.

924
01:08:12,132 --> 01:08:13,476
Because of him.

925
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:15,510
Me?

926
01:08:16,512 --> 01:08:18,653
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

927
01:08:18,653 --> 01:08:21,905
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

928
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:23,942
We learned that
not only are we not alone,

929
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:28,228
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously outgunned.

930
01:08:28,357 --> 01:08:30,233
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

931
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:32,366
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

932
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,583
And you're not the only threat.

933
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:37,625
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

934
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:39,804
that can't be controlled.

935
01:08:39,804 --> 01:08:40,923
Like you controlled the Cube?

936
01:08:40,923 --> 01:08:45,048
Your work with the Tesseract
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

937
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:46,672
It is a signal to all the realms

938
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:49,477
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

939
01:08:49,477 --> 01:08:51,819
- A higher form?
- You forced our hand.

940
01:08:52,048 --> 01:08:53,866
- We had to come up with something.
- A nuclear deterrent.

941
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:55,932
Cause that always
calms everything right down.

942
01:08:56,164 --> 01:08:58,749
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

943
01:08:58,749 --> 01:09:00,857
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

944
01:09:00,857 --> 01:09:02,940
Wait, wait. Hold on.
How is this now about me?

945
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,299
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

946
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:06,204
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

947
01:09:06,204 --> 01:09:09,309
Excuse me, did we come
to your planet and blow stuff up?

948
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:11,155
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

949
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:12,740
Are you boys really that naive?

950
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,288
- S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.
- Captain America's on threat watch?

951
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:17,257
We all are.

952
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:18,985
You're on that list?

953
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:20,660
Are you above or below angry bees?

954
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,909
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

955
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,283
Threat! Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

956
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:26,062
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

957
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:36,992
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.</i>

958
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:39,183
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

959
01:09:39,183 --> 01:09:40,987
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

960
01:09:41,808 --> 01:09:43,808
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

961
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:54,984
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

962
01:09:55,113 --> 01:09:56,544
That's his M.O., isn't it?

963
01:09:56,656 --> 01:09:57,964
I mean, what are we, a team?

964
01:09:57,964 --> 01:10:01,046
No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

965
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:05,128
- We're... we're a time bomb.
- You need to step away.

966
01:10:05,128 --> 01:10:07,092
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

967
01:10:07,092 --> 01:10:09,319
You know damn well why.
Back off!

968
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,051
Oh, I'm startin'
to want you to make me.

969
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:14,475
Yeah. Big man in a suit o' armor.

970
01:10:15,759 --> 01:10:17,118
Take that off, what are you?

971
01:10:17,118 --> 01:10:19,807
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

972
01:10:20,556 --> 01:10:22,863
I know guys with none o' that
worth ten o' you.

973
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:24,847
I've seen the footage.

974
01:10:24,977 --> 01:10:27,219
The only thing you really fight for
is yourself.

975
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,083
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

976
01:10:30,504 --> 01:10:32,998
to lay down on a wire and
the other guy crawl over you?

977
01:10:32,998 --> 01:10:34,740
I think
I would just cut the wire.

978
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:39,372
Always a way out.

979
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:41,501
You know,
you may not be a threat,

980
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:43,670
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

981
01:10:43,871 --> 01:10:45,566
A hero? Like you?

982
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:48,047
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

983
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,380
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

984
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:19,661
Put on the suit.
Let's go a few rounds.

985
01:11:21,368 --> 01:11:25,769
- You people are so petty... and tiny.
- Yeah, this is a team.

986
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:28,249
Agent Romanoff, would you escort
dr. Banner back to his...

987
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:31,804
- Where? You rented my room.
- The cell was just in...

988
01:11:31,804 --> 01:11:35,886
In case you needed to kill me.
But you can't. I know, I tried.

989
01:11:39,343 --> 01:11:42,304
I got low.
I didn't see an end.

990
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:45,856
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

991
01:11:47,478 --> 01:11:48,314
So I moved on.

992
01:11:48,314 --> 01:11:51,521
I focused on
helping other people. I was good.

993
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,981
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

994
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,485
and put everyone here at risk.

995
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,409
You wanna know my secret,
agent Romanoff?

996
01:11:57,409 --> 01:11:59,239
You wanna know how I stay calm?

997
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:03,517
Dr. Banner...

998
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:06,879
put down the sceptre.

999
01:12:15,507 --> 01:12:16,231
Got it.

1000
01:12:17,758 --> 01:12:18,187
Sorry, kids,

1001
01:12:18,187 --> 01:12:20,405
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1002
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:22,321
- You located the Tesseract?
- I could get there fastest.

1003
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:24,682
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1004
01:12:24,682 --> 01:12:26,193
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1005
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:28,744
- Put on the suit, let's find out.
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1006
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:30,017
Put on the suit.

1007
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:33,373
Oh, my God.

1008
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:51,632
- Put on the suit.
- Yeah.

1009
01:12:55,214 --> 01:12:56,554
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1010
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:02,595
- Hill!
- External detonation.

1011
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:05,099
- Number three engine is down.
- We've been hit.

1012
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:07,040
- Can they get it running?
- We got a fire in engine three!

1013
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:07,568
Talk to me.

1014
01:13:07,568 --> 01:13:09,480
Turbine looks mostly intact

1015
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,447
but it's impossible to get
out there to make repairs

1016
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:12,684
while we're in the air.

1017
01:13:13,233 --> 01:13:15,199
We lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1018
01:13:15,902 --> 01:13:17,742
<i>Somebody's gotta get outside
and patch that engine.</i>

1019
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:19,493
- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.

1020
01:13:19,493 --> 01:13:23,027
<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section,</i>

1021
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,410
<i>then get to the armory.</i>

1022
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:25,534
Romanoff?

1023
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,625
We're okay.

1024
01:13:33,212 --> 01:13:34,127
We're okay, right?

1025
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:48,257
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:49,767
Detention,
wait for cameras to go dark.

1027
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:51,124
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1028
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:55,457
Let's go! Level 4.

1029
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:57,965
Engine three.
I'll meet you there.

1030
01:14:07,205 --> 01:14:07,868
Doctor?

1031
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:11,595
Bruce...

1032
01:14:12,043 --> 01:14:14,965
You gotta fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1033
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,260
We're gonna be okay.
Listen to me.

1034
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:19,594
You hurt?

1035
01:14:22,554 --> 01:14:24,786
We're gonna be okay.
All right?

1036
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:27,444
I swear... on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1037
01:14:27,444 --> 01:14:29,143
You will walk away
and never ever...

1038
01:14:29,269 --> 01:14:29,811
Your life?

1039
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:48,972
Bruce...

1040
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:28,419
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1041
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:30,632
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1042
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:32,758
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1043
01:15:32,758 --> 01:15:34,663
Is the sun coming up?

1044
01:15:35,671 --> 01:15:37,691
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1045
01:15:38,006 --> 01:15:39,338
Get us over water.

1046
01:15:39,512 --> 01:15:41,968
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1047
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:44,928
Thanks.

1048
01:15:48,768 --> 01:15:49,515
Stark!

1049
01:15:52,646 --> 01:15:54,098
Stark, I'm here!

1050
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,166
<i>Good.</i>

1051
01:15:57,151 --> 01:15:57,937
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1052
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:01,828
I gotta get this superconducting
coolant system back online

1053
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:05,319
before I can access the rotors,
work on dislodging the debris.

1054
01:16:08,162 --> 01:16:09,589
<i>I need you to get to
that engine control panel,</i>

1055
01:16:09,589 --> 01:16:11,642
<i>tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

1056
01:16:25,806 --> 01:16:26,975
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1057
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,347
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1058
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:32,151
Well, you're not wrong.

1059
01:17:36,294 --> 01:17:38,789
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1060
01:17:39,256 --> 01:17:40,606
Try to think!

1061
01:17:50,392 --> 01:17:51,805
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

1062
01:17:52,394 --> 01:17:53,684
What's our next move?

1063
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:54,806
Even if I clear the rotors,

1064
01:17:54,806 --> 01:17:57,030
this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.

1065
01:17:57,264 --> 01:17:58,453
I'm gonna have
to get in there and push.

1066
01:17:58,453 --> 01:18:00,519
Well, if that thing gets up to speed,
you'll get shredded.

1067
01:18:00,519 --> 01:18:02,664
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1068
01:18:02,664 --> 01:18:04,358
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

1069
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:05,773
Speak English!

1070
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:08,357
See that red lever?

1071
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:11,579
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

1072
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:13,746
Stand by it.
Wait for my word.

1073
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,004
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1074
01:19:11,225 --> 01:19:12,274
Grenade!

1075
01:19:27,408 --> 01:19:28,525
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1076
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:32,090
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.
Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1077
01:19:40,422 --> 01:19:44,054
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4. Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1078
01:19:44,054 --> 01:19:46,387
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1079
01:19:47,763 --> 01:19:48,758
Get his attention.

1080
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:52,767
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1081
01:19:53,185 --> 01:19:55,484
<i>- Don't get too close.
- Copy.</i>

1082
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:09,143
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1083
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:14,577
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1084
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:27,761
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1085
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:38,525
They're not getting through here,
so what the hell...

1086
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,423
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1087
01:22:07,448 --> 01:22:09,453
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1088
01:22:09,742 --> 01:22:11,664
<i>Sir, we've lost all power
in engine one.</i>

1089
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:13,847
<i>It's Barton.
He took out our systems.</i>

1090
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:15,694
<i>He's headed
for the detention level.</i>

1091
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:17,987
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1092
01:22:19,877 --> 01:22:21,194
This is agent Romanoff.

1093
01:22:22,129 --> 01:22:23,155
I copy.

1094
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:29,215
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1095
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:30,871
Yeah, I noticed.

1096
01:22:59,835 --> 01:23:00,692
No!

1097
01:23:08,469 --> 01:23:10,844
Are you ever
not going to fall for that?

1098
01:23:54,182 --> 01:23:55,913
The humans think us immortal.

1099
01:23:57,519 --> 01:23:58,876
Should we test that?

1100
01:24:01,857 --> 01:24:03,161
Move away, please.

1101
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:08,699
You like this?

1102
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,849
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1103
01:24:14,453 --> 01:24:16,064
Even I don't know
what it does.

1104
01:24:17,498 --> 01:24:18,649
You wanna find out?

1105
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,210
No!

1106
01:25:31,741 --> 01:25:33,075
Natasha?

1107
01:26:04,733 --> 01:26:05,833
You're gonna lose.

1108
01:26:08,528 --> 01:26:09,653
Am I?

1109
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:12,592
It's in your nature.

1110
01:26:15,702 --> 01:26:17,495
Your heroes are scattered.

1111
01:26:18,163 --> 01:26:21,114
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1112
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,625
Where is my disadvantage?

1113
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:26,029
You lack conviction.

1114
01:26:27,214 --> 01:26:28,210
I don't think I'm...

1115
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,657
So, that's what it does.

1116
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:41,246
<i>All hands
to crash stations immediately.</i>

1117
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,297
- Cap, hit the lever.
- I need a minute here!

1118
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,199
Lever...

1119
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:15,872
now!

1120
01:27:27,985 --> 01:27:28,982
<i>Help!</i>

1121
01:28:04,731 --> 01:28:05,936
Sorry, boss.

1122
01:28:06,232 --> 01:28:07,512
The god rabbited.

1123
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:10,979
Just stay awake.
Eyes on me.

1124
01:28:11,404 --> 01:28:14,341
- No, I'm clocking out here.
- Not an option.

1125
01:28:15,575 --> 01:28:17,175
It's okay, boss.

1126
01:28:19,454 --> 01:28:21,224
This was never gonna work...

1127
01:28:21,623 --> 01:28:22,911
if they didn't have something...

1128
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:25,373
to...

1129
01:28:54,907 --> 01:28:56,734
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1130
01:28:58,119 --> 01:28:59,827
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

1131
01:28:59,954 --> 01:29:00,731
<i>They're here.</i>

1132
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:06,158
<i>They called it.</i>

1133
01:29:22,728 --> 01:29:24,785
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1134
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:29,931
I guess he never did get you
to sign them.

1135
01:29:33,322 --> 01:29:34,819
We're dead in the air up here.

1136
01:29:35,115 --> 01:29:37,464
Our communications,
location of the Cube...

1137
01:29:38,327 --> 01:29:41,095
Banner, Thor...

1138
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:43,579
I got nothing for you.

1139
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:46,726
I lost my one good eye.

1140
01:29:50,047 --> 01:29:51,614
Maybe I had that comin'.

1141
01:29:57,263 --> 01:29:58,535
Yes...

1142
01:29:59,724 --> 01:30:03,210
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1143
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,430
I never put all my chips
on that number, though,

1144
01:30:06,564 --> 01:30:08,954
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1145
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:17,641
There was an idea.
Stark knows this.

1146
01:30:19,578 --> 01:30:22,215
Called the Avengers Initiative.

1147
01:30:24,124 --> 01:30:26,247
The idea was
to bring together a group

1148
01:30:26,376 --> 01:30:28,058
of remarkable people...

1149
01:30:29,713 --> 01:30:31,847
to see if they could become
something more.

1150
01:30:33,926 --> 01:30:36,954
See if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1151
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,528
to fight the battles
that we never could.

1152
01:30:44,311 --> 01:30:48,765
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1153
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:52,774
In heroes.

1154
01:31:01,245 --> 01:31:02,346
Well...

1155
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:06,054
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1156
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:28,972
You fell out of the sky.

1157
01:31:43,163 --> 01:31:44,634
Did I hurt anybody?

1158
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,095
There's nobody
around here to get hurt.

1159
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,595
You did scare the hell
out o' some pigeons, though.

1160
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:54,657
- Lucky.
- Or... just good aim.

1161
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,586
You were awake when you fell.

1162
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,444
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1163
01:32:00,444 --> 01:32:02,086
Right through the ceiling.

1164
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,922
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1165
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:07,821
Here.

1166
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,137
Didn't think those would fit you
until you shrunk down

1167
01:32:11,137 --> 01:32:13,221
to a regular-size feller.

1168
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,499
Thank you.

1169
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,778
You an alien?

1170
01:32:20,314 --> 01:32:21,272
What?

1171
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,420
From outer space, an alien.

1172
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,860
No.

1173
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,470
Well, then, son,
you've got a condition.

1174
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,872
Clint. You're gonna be all right.

1175
01:32:44,852 --> 01:32:46,289
You know that?

1176
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:49,203
Is that what you know?

1177
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:54,761
I got... I got no window.

1178
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:57,501
I have to flush 'im out.

1179
01:32:58,073 --> 01:32:59,900
You got to level out.
It's gonna take time.

1180
01:33:00,034 --> 01:33:01,379
You don't understand.

1181
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:06,508
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1182
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:11,109
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1183
01:33:14,924 --> 01:33:16,976
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1184
01:33:18,845 --> 01:33:20,367
You know that I do.

1185
01:33:28,813 --> 01:33:30,255
Why am I back?

1186
01:33:30,982 --> 01:33:34,254
- How'd you get 'im out?
- Cognitive recalibration.

1187
01:33:35,445 --> 01:33:37,019
I hit you really hard
on the head.

1188
01:33:38,682 --> 01:33:39,589
Thanks.

1189
01:33:43,662 --> 01:33:44,982
Natasha...

1190
01:33:46,081 --> 01:33:47,667
- How many agents did I...
- Don't.

1191
01:33:48,876 --> 01:33:50,885
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1192
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,226
This is Loki.

1193
01:33:53,505 --> 01:33:56,127
This is... monsters and magic,

1194
01:33:56,258 --> 01:33:58,082
and nothing
we were ever trained for.

1195
01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:00,642
- Loki, he get away?
- Yeah.

1196
01:34:01,013 --> 01:34:02,536
I don't suppose you know where.

1197
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:04,706
Didn't need to know.

1198
01:34:05,309 --> 01:34:06,191
Didn't ask.

1199
01:34:10,314 --> 01:34:12,353
He's gonna
make his play soon, though.

1200
01:34:13,454 --> 01:34:15,580
- Today.
- We gotta stop 'im.

1201
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:19,554
- Yeah? Who's "we"?
- I don't know. Whoever's left.

1202
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:21,794
Well...

1203
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:25,710
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1204
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:28,506
I'd... sleep better, I suppose.

1205
01:34:31,711 --> 01:34:33,216
Now you sound like you.

1206
01:34:34,005 --> 01:34:35,361
But you don't.

1207
01:34:37,384 --> 01:34:40,032
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1208
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:44,660
Now, you want to...
wade into a war. Why?

1209
01:34:46,852 --> 01:34:48,543
What did Loki do to you?

1210
01:34:49,563 --> 01:34:51,832
He didn't. I just...

1211
01:34:55,736 --> 01:34:57,278
Natasha.

1212
01:34:59,365 --> 01:35:01,374
I've been compromised.

1213
01:35:04,453 --> 01:35:06,346
I got red in my ledger.

1214
01:35:08,707 --> 01:35:10,380
I'd like to wipe it out.

1215
01:35:26,809 --> 01:35:29,167
- Was he married?
- No.

1216
01:35:29,979 --> 01:35:34,123
There was a, uh... cellist, I think.

1217
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:38,700
I'm sorry.
He seemed like a good man.

1218
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:43,794
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?

1219
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:47,291
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.

1220
01:35:47,831 --> 01:35:50,369
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1221
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,532
He should have...

1222
01:35:51,668 --> 01:35:53,246
Sometimes there isn't
a way out, Tony.

1223
01:35:53,378 --> 01:35:55,232
Right. I've heard that before.

1224
01:35:55,631 --> 01:35:56,925
Is this the first time
you lost a soldier?

1225
01:35:56,925 --> 01:35:59,074
We are not soldiers.

1226
01:36:03,514 --> 01:36:06,267
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.

1227
01:36:06,684 --> 01:36:08,418
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1228
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:10,238
But, right now,
we gotta put that behind us

1229
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:12,045
and get this done.

1230
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:13,852
Now, Loki needs a power source.

1231
01:36:13,983 --> 01:36:15,861
- If we can put together a list...
- He made it personal.

1232
01:36:16,277 --> 01:36:19,501
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1233
01:36:19,947 --> 01:36:21,856
He hit us all
right where we live. Why?

1234
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:22,987
To tear us apart.

1235
01:36:23,117 --> 01:36:24,928
Yeah,
divide and conquer is... great but...

1236
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,575
he knows he has to take us out
to win, right?

1237
01:36:27,705 --> 01:36:29,082
That's what he wants.

1238
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:31,542
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1239
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:33,125
He wants an audience.

1240
01:36:33,836 --> 01:36:35,179
Right.
I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1241
01:36:35,179 --> 01:36:38,548
Yeah. That's just previews.
This is... this is opening night.

1242
01:36:38,675 --> 01:36:41,213
And... Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1243
01:36:41,344 --> 01:36:42,805
He wants flowers,
he wants parades...

1244
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:46,057
He wants a... monument built
to the skies with his name plastered...

1245
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:49,574
Son of a bitch.

1246
01:37:01,251 --> 01:37:02,247
Time to go.

1247
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:04,033
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1248
01:37:04,033 --> 01:37:05,280
Can you fly one of those jets?

1249
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,101
I can.

1250
01:37:12,001 --> 01:37:13,725
- You got a suit?
- Yeah.

1251
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:15,603
Then suit up.

1252
01:37:43,408 --> 01:37:44,720
Hey, you guys aren't
authorized to be in here.

1253
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:47,265
Son... Just don't.

1254
01:37:49,205 --> 01:37:51,342
- Sir.
- Agent Hill?

1255
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:53,090
Those cards...

1256
01:37:55,754 --> 01:37:59,546
They were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1257
01:38:04,638 --> 01:38:06,307
They needed the push.

1258
01:38:09,309 --> 01:38:11,768
<i>We have an unauthorized departure
from Bay 6.</i>

1259
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:13,579
They found him.

1260
01:38:14,648 --> 01:38:17,296
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1261
01:38:18,485 --> 01:38:20,621
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1262
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:36,037
<i>Sir, I've turned off
the arc reactor</i>

1263
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:39,424
<i>but the device
is already self-sustaining.</i>

1264
01:38:40,133 --> 01:38:41,802
<i>Shut it down, dr. Selvig.</i>

1265
01:38:42,969 --> 01:38:44,241
It's too late!

1266
01:38:46,306 --> 01:38:47,769
She can't stop now.

1267
01:38:48,808 --> 01:38:50,690
She wants to show us something!

1268
01:38:51,394 --> 01:38:53,073
A new universe.

1269
01:38:53,563 --> 01:38:54,732
<i>Okay.</i>

1270
01:39:02,155 --> 01:39:04,029
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1271
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:05,706
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1272
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:07,442
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1273
01:39:09,162 --> 01:39:10,337
<i>Plan B.</i>

1274
01:39:11,331 --> 01:39:13,245
<i>Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.</i>

1275
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:15,383
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1276
01:39:35,523 --> 01:39:38,355
Please, tell me you're going to
appeal to my humanity.

1277
01:39:39,485 --> 01:39:41,442
Uh, actually,
I'm planning to threaten you.

1278
01:39:42,196 --> 01:39:43,655
You should have left
your armor on for that.

1279
01:39:43,781 --> 01:39:44,445
Yeah.

1280
01:39:45,325 --> 01:39:46,237
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1281
01:39:46,237 --> 01:39:49,216
and you got
the, uh... glow stick of destiny.

1282
01:39:49,954 --> 01:39:51,212
Would you like a drink?

1283
01:39:52,373 --> 01:39:53,488
Stalling me
won't change anything.

1284
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,830
No, no, no. Threatening.

1285
01:39:55,877 --> 01:39:57,124
No drink? You sure?

1286
01:39:57,379 --> 01:39:58,835
I'm havin' one.

1287
01:39:59,965 --> 01:40:03,879
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1288
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:07,135
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.

1289
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,077
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sorta like a team.

1290
01:40:12,561 --> 01:40:16,268
- "Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.
- Yes, I've met them.

1291
01:40:16,315 --> 01:40:17,144
Yeah.

1292
01:40:17,483 --> 01:40:18,645
It takes us a while
to get any traction,

1293
01:40:18,776 --> 01:40:19,563
I'll give you that one.

1294
01:40:19,563 --> 01:40:21,610
But, let's do a head count, here.

1295
01:40:22,237 --> 01:40:24,208
Your brother, the demigod...

1296
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:29,914
a super soldier, a living legend
who kinda lives up to the legend.

1297
01:40:30,162 --> 01:40:33,327
A man with breath-taking
anger-management issues,

1298
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:36,563
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella...

1299
01:40:37,169 --> 01:40:39,790
you've managed to piss off
every single one of 'em.

1300
01:40:40,256 --> 01:40:42,523
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.

1301
01:40:43,509 --> 01:40:44,425
When they come,

1302
01:40:45,678 --> 01:40:46,673
and they will,

1303
01:40:47,263 --> 01:40:48,302
they'll come for you.

1304
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,718
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.

1305
01:40:51,434 --> 01:40:52,809
Oh, I thought
the beast had wandered off.

1306
01:40:52,936 --> 01:40:54,568
You-you're missing the point.
There's no throne.

1307
01:40:54,807 --> 01:40:58,317
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1308
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:01,309
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1309
01:41:01,309 --> 01:41:02,899
but it's all on you.

1310
01:41:04,364 --> 01:41:05,275
Cause, if we can't protect the Earth,

1311
01:41:05,275 --> 01:41:07,451
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1312
01:41:10,658 --> 01:41:15,828
How will your friends have time for me...
when they're so busy fighting you?

1313
01:41:23,175 --> 01:41:23,921
This usually works.

1314
01:41:23,921 --> 01:41:27,061
Well, performance issues,
it's not... uncommon.

1315
01:41:27,304 --> 01:41:28,084
One outta five...

1316
01:41:30,683 --> 01:41:32,851
Jarvis... anytime now.

1317
01:41:35,354 --> 01:41:37,945
You will all fall before me.

1318
01:41:38,232 --> 01:41:39,286
Deploy!

1319
01:41:39,734 --> 01:41:40,578
Deploy!

1320
01:42:08,346 --> 01:42:10,923
<i>And there's one other person
you pissed off.</i>

1321
01:42:12,434 --> 01:42:13,642
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1322
01:42:37,459 --> 01:42:38,372
Right.

1323
01:42:39,086 --> 01:42:40,093
Army.

1324
01:43:52,703 --> 01:43:53,485
Loki!

1325
01:43:54,121 --> 01:43:56,161
Turn off the Tesseract,
or I'll destroy it.

1326
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:56,875
You can't.

1327
01:43:57,458 --> 01:43:58,886
There is no stopping it.

1328
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:00,500
There is only...

1329
01:44:01,379 --> 01:44:02,159
the war.

1330
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:03,730
So be it.

1331
01:44:25,862 --> 01:44:27,638
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed north-east.</i>

1332
01:44:27,638 --> 01:44:29,520
What, did you stop
for drive-through?

1333
01:44:29,851 --> 01:44:31,749
Swing up Park. I'm gonna
lay 'em out for you.

1334
01:44:49,762 --> 01:44:51,090
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1335
01:44:51,222 --> 01:44:53,102
Fine. Let's keep 'em occupied.

1336
01:44:59,856 --> 01:45:01,920
- Nat?
- I see 'im.

1337
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:47,409
We gotta get back up there.

1338
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:40,916
Stark, are you seeing this?

1339
01:46:42,044 --> 01:46:44,156
<i>Seeing.
Still workin' on believing.</i>

1340
01:46:44,415 --> 01:46:45,531
Where's Banner?
He shown up yet?

1341
01:46:46,131 --> 01:46:46,928
<i>Banner?</i>

1342
01:46:47,299 --> 01:46:48,579
Just keep me posted.

1343
01:46:49,051 --> 01:46:50,581
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1344
01:46:53,472 --> 01:46:54,192
Look at this!

1345
01:46:55,474 --> 01:46:56,641
Look around you!

1346
01:46:57,476 --> 01:47:00,273
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1347
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,474
It's too late.

1348
01:47:04,483 --> 01:47:09,232
- It's too late to stop it.
- No. We can. Together.

1349
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:17,544
Sentiment.

1350
01:47:46,026 --> 01:47:48,134
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1351
01:47:49,738 --> 01:47:50,495
Loki.

1352
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:03,376
They're fish in a barrel
down there.

1353
01:48:09,634 --> 01:48:12,916
- We got this. It's good. Go.
- You think you can hold them off?

1354
01:48:13,221 --> 01:48:14,089
Captain,

1355
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:17,981
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1356
01:48:45,921 --> 01:48:47,927
Just like Budapest all over again.

1357
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:50,576
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1358
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:09,093
It's to be an hour before
they can scramble the National Guard.

1359
01:49:09,093 --> 01:49:10,196
National Guard?

1360
01:49:12,198 --> 01:49:13,692
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1361
01:49:14,223 --> 01:49:15,268
Do we?

1362
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,157
You need men in these buildings.

1363
01:49:17,157 --> 01:49:18,580
There are people inside
and they're gonna be running

1364
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:20,035
right into the line of fire.

1365
01:49:20,317 --> 01:49:22,365
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1366
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:23,657
You keep them off the streets.

1367
01:49:23,864 --> 01:49:26,730
I need a perimeter
as far back as 39th.

1368
01:49:26,963 --> 01:49:28,714
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1369
01:49:42,312 --> 01:49:43,645
I need men in those buildings.

1370
01:49:43,645 --> 01:49:45,546
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1371
01:49:45,546 --> 01:49:45,988
You got it.

1372
01:49:45,988 --> 01:49:48,842
We're gonna set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1373
01:49:58,832 --> 01:50:00,740
Well... We got its attention.

1374
01:50:00,873 --> 01:50:02,238
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1375
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,024
What's the story upstairs?

1376
01:50:33,024 --> 01:50:35,098
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1377
01:50:35,098 --> 01:50:37,580
<i>Thor's right. We gotta deal
with these guys.</i>

1378
01:50:37,945 --> 01:50:39,827
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1379
01:50:39,954 --> 01:50:41,302
I have unfinished business
with Loki.

1380
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:43,586
- Yeah? Well, get in line.
- Save it.

1381
01:50:44,084 --> 01:50:45,412
Loki's gonna keep
this fight focused on us,

1382
01:50:45,544 --> 01:50:46,312
and that's what we need.

1383
01:50:46,312 --> 01:50:48,067
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1384
01:50:48,295 --> 01:50:50,776
We got Stark up top.
He's gonna need us to...

1385
01:50:58,807 --> 01:51:02,291
So... This all seems horrible.

1386
01:51:03,062 --> 01:51:05,335
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.

1387
01:51:05,335 --> 01:51:08,576
No, we could use... a little worse.

1388
01:51:08,576 --> 01:51:11,188
<i>- Stark, we got 'im.
- Banner?</i>

1389
01:51:11,188 --> 01:51:12,299
Just like you said.

1390
01:51:12,299 --> 01:51:15,567
Then, tell 'im to suit up.
I'm bringin' the party to you.

1391
01:51:21,915 --> 01:51:23,913
I-I don't see how that's a party.

1392
01:51:31,674 --> 01:51:32,543
Dr. Banner.

1393
01:51:34,427 --> 01:51:36,547
Now might be a really good time
for you to get angry.

1394
01:51:37,263 --> 01:51:38,783
That's my secret, Captain.

1395
01:51:41,265 --> 01:51:42,540
I'm always angry.

1396
01:51:54,156 --> 01:51:55,070
<i>Hold on!</i>

1397
01:52:25,688 --> 01:52:27,186
Send the rest.

1398
01:52:33,988 --> 01:52:34,879
Guys...

1399
01:52:35,365 --> 01:52:36,018
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1400
01:52:36,699 --> 01:52:37,307
A'ight, listen up.

1401
01:52:37,992 --> 01:52:40,482
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1402
01:52:40,764 --> 01:52:41,878
Barton,
I want you on that roof.

1403
01:52:41,878 --> 01:52:43,985
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1404
01:52:43,985 --> 01:52:45,484
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1405
01:52:45,484 --> 01:52:46,938
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1406
01:52:46,938 --> 01:52:48,503
you turn it back
or you turn it to ash.

1407
01:52:48,503 --> 01:52:50,035
- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.

1408
01:52:50,171 --> 01:52:51,632
<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1409
01:52:54,843 --> 01:52:57,194
Thor... You gotta try
and bottleneck that portal.

1410
01:52:57,345 --> 01:52:58,246
Slow 'em down.

1411
01:52:58,246 --> 01:53:00,670
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1412
01:53:03,101 --> 01:53:04,372
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1413
01:53:04,372 --> 01:53:05,759
Keep the fighting here.

1414
01:53:06,021 --> 01:53:07,041
And Hulk...

1415
01:53:09,733 --> 01:53:10,731
Smash.

1416
01:54:04,414 --> 01:54:05,016
Sir.

1417
01:54:06,583 --> 01:54:07,579
The Council is on.

1418
01:54:12,464 --> 01:54:15,319
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1419
01:54:17,553 --> 01:54:19,318
I'm just tryin' to keep them
off the streets.

1420
01:54:19,318 --> 01:54:21,463
Well, they can't bank
worth a damn.

1421
01:54:22,099 --> 01:54:23,213
So, find a tight corner.

1422
01:54:23,213 --> 01:54:24,659
I will roger that.

1423
01:54:47,709 --> 01:54:49,055
Oh, boy.

1424
01:54:55,884 --> 01:54:56,864
Nice call.

1425
01:54:57,635 --> 01:54:58,572
What else you got?

1426
01:54:58,572 --> 01:55:00,984
<i>Thor is takin' on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1427
01:55:01,890 --> 01:55:03,792
And he didn't invite me.

1428
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:45,224
Captain, none o' this
is gonna mean a damn thing

1429
01:55:45,351 --> 01:55:46,596
if we don't close that portal.

1430
01:55:46,728 --> 01:55:49,714
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
- Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1431
01:55:52,692 --> 01:55:54,620
If you wanna get up there,
you're gonna need a ride.

1432
01:55:55,737 --> 01:55:56,844
I got a ride.

1433
01:55:57,947 --> 01:55:58,979
I could use a boost, though.

1434
01:56:01,576 --> 01:56:04,932
- You sure about this?
- Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1435
01:56:32,608 --> 01:56:34,369
Okay, turn, turn. Turn!

1436
01:56:34,892 --> 01:56:35,812
Less!

1437
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:01,594
<i>Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.</i>

1438
01:58:01,857 --> 01:58:03,502
<i>They cornered
a lot o' civilians in there.</i>

1439
01:58:03,835 --> 01:58:04,914
I'm on it.

1440
01:58:26,058 --> 01:58:26,858
Everyone! Clear out!

1441
01:58:57,757 --> 01:58:58,891
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1442
01:58:59,550 --> 01:59:00,767
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1443
01:59:00,767 --> 01:59:03,823
I recognize the Council
has made a decision.

1444
01:59:03,981 --> 01:59:05,935
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1445
01:59:05,935 --> 01:59:07,233
I've elected to ignore it.

1446
01:59:07,233 --> 01:59:10,699
<i>Director... You're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

1447
01:59:10,699 --> 01:59:11,993
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1448
01:59:11,993 --> 01:59:14,823
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1449
01:59:15,025 --> 01:59:16,766
Until I'm certain
my team can't hold it,

1450
01:59:16,766 --> 01:59:20,630
I will not order a nuclear strike
against a civilian population.

1451
01:59:20,906 --> 01:59:23,020
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

1452
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:25,339
If I send that bird out,
we already have.

1453
01:59:29,957 --> 01:59:31,113
Now, you.

1454
01:59:33,919 --> 01:59:34,841
Hawkeye!

1455
01:59:36,547 --> 01:59:37,542
Nat, what are you doin'?

1456
01:59:38,465 --> 01:59:39,402
A little help?

1457
01:59:44,763 --> 01:59:45,859
I got 'im.

1458
02:00:12,333 --> 02:00:13,329
Enough!

1459
02:00:13,668 --> 02:00:15,676
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1460
02:00:16,254 --> 02:00:18,452
I am a god, you dull creature.

1461
02:00:19,132 --> 02:00:20,690
And I will not be bullied by...

1462
02:00:30,477 --> 02:00:31,824
Puny god.

1463
02:00:40,487 --> 02:00:41,630
The sceptre...

1464
02:00:43,115 --> 02:00:43,957
Doctor...

1465
02:00:46,201 --> 02:00:48,667
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1466
02:00:49,163 --> 02:00:52,714
The Tesseract can't fight,
you can't protect against yourself.

1467
02:00:53,125 --> 02:00:53,608
It's not your fault.

1468
02:00:53,608 --> 02:00:55,173
You didn't know
what you were doing.

1469
02:00:58,096 --> 02:00:59,942
Well, actually, I think I did.

1470
02:01:00,682 --> 02:01:03,318
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1471
02:01:04,932 --> 02:01:05,985
Loki's sceptre.

1472
02:01:06,556 --> 02:01:08,444
It may be able
to close the portal.

1473
02:01:11,227 --> 02:01:12,953
And I'm looking right at it.

1474
02:01:25,367 --> 02:01:28,046
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1475
02:01:35,671 --> 02:01:38,968
Jarvis... You ever hear
the tale of Jonah?

1476
02:01:38,968 --> 02:01:41,450
<i>I wouldn't consider him
a role model.</i>

1477
02:02:51,288 --> 02:02:52,756
<i>Director Fury is no longer
in command.</i>

1478
02:02:52,756 --> 02:02:54,979
<i>Override order 7-Alpha-1- 1.</i>

1479
02:02:54,979 --> 02:02:57,922
<i>7- Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.</i>

1480
02:02:58,837 --> 02:03:00,727
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1481
02:03:01,423 --> 02:03:03,093
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1482
02:03:03,093 --> 02:03:07,157
We need to shut it down!
Repeat, takeoff is not authorized.

1483
02:03:37,711 --> 02:03:38,940
Stark, you hear me?

1484
02:03:40,005 --> 02:03:42,128
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1485
02:03:42,401 --> 02:03:43,264
<i>How long?</i>

1486
02:03:44,176 --> 02:03:45,610
<i>Three minutes. Max.</i>

1487
02:03:46,011 --> 02:03:47,827
<i>Payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1488
02:03:48,138 --> 02:03:49,894
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1489
02:03:49,894 --> 02:03:51,225
<i>I just did.</i>

1490
02:04:04,864 --> 02:04:06,129
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1491
02:04:06,323 --> 02:04:09,365
<i>Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>

1492
02:04:32,225 --> 02:04:33,608
You're ready for another bout?

1493
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:36,361
What, you getting sleepy?

1494
02:04:41,902 --> 02:04:43,253
Right at the crown!

1495
02:04:49,659 --> 02:04:50,993
I can close it.

1496
02:04:51,578 --> 02:04:53,047
Can anybody copy?

1497
02:04:53,747 --> 02:04:54,862
I can shut the portal down.

1498
02:04:54,998 --> 02:04:56,852
- Do it!
- No, wait.

1499
02:04:56,852 --> 02:04:58,170
Stark, these things are still comin'.

1500
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:00,666
I got a nuke comin' in.
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1501
02:05:11,265 --> 02:05:13,092
And I know just where to put it.

1502
02:05:19,916 --> 02:05:22,358
<i>Stark... you know
that's a one-way trip.</i>

1503
02:05:22,358 --> 02:05:23,831
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1504
02:05:23,831 --> 02:05:27,050
<i>Sir... Shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1505
02:05:28,491 --> 02:05:29,528
Might as well.

1506
02:05:32,453 --> 02:05:34,725
<i>The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.</i>

1507
02:05:34,725 --> 02:05:37,248
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

1508
02:05:37,248 --> 02:05:39,497
<i>but, clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1509
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:41,666
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,</i>

1510
02:05:41,796 --> 02:05:43,886
<i>I have never seen
anything like this.</i>

1511
02:05:44,841 --> 02:05:46,408
<i>We have limited information
on the team</i>

1512
02:05:46,408 --> 02:05:50,216
<i>but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1513
02:07:03,547 --> 02:07:05,085
Come on, Stark.

1514
02:07:12,014 --> 02:07:13,202
Close it.

1515
02:07:33,202 --> 02:07:34,198
Son of a gun.

1516
02:07:38,958 --> 02:07:40,327
He's not slowing down.

1517
02:07:58,645 --> 02:07:59,971
Is he breathing?

1518
02:08:27,967 --> 02:08:29,233
What the hell?

1519
02:08:32,096 --> 02:08:33,300
What just happened?

1520
02:08:34,348 --> 02:08:35,437
Please tell me
nobody kissed me.

1521
02:08:40,938 --> 02:08:42,222
We won.

1522
02:08:44,943 --> 02:08:47,898
All right, yay!
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1523
02:08:48,446 --> 02:08:51,482
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just... take a day.

1524
02:08:52,534 --> 02:08:53,904
You ever tried shawarma?

1525
02:08:54,536 --> 02:08:56,804
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1526
02:08:56,804 --> 02:08:58,594
I don't know what it is,
but I wanna try it.

1527
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:00,338
We're not finished yet.

1528
02:09:05,464 --> 02:09:06,961
And then shawarma after.

1529
02:09:29,238 --> 02:09:30,772
If it's all the same to you...

1530
02:09:34,785 --> 02:09:36,403
I'll have that drink now.

1531
02:09:44,337 --> 02:09:46,376
<i>Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed</i>

1532
02:09:46,506 --> 02:09:47,955
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1533
02:09:47,955 --> 02:09:49,646
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1534
02:09:49,646 --> 02:09:51,545
<i>of the group known as
the Avengers</i>

1535
02:09:51,813 --> 02:09:54,109
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,</i>

1536
02:09:54,109 --> 02:09:54,759
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1537
02:09:54,889 --> 02:09:56,510
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there, you know?</i>

1538
02:09:57,434 --> 02:09:58,883
<i>That someone is watchin' over us.</i>

1539
02:09:59,352 --> 02:10:00,550
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1540
02:10:00,687 --> 02:10:02,189
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1541
02:10:02,522 --> 02:10:03,471
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1542
02:10:03,982 --> 02:10:05,357
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes...</i>

1543
02:10:05,483 --> 02:10:06,057
<i>I don't know.</i>

1544
02:10:06,057 --> 02:10:08,974
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

1545
02:10:08,974 --> 02:10:11,689
<i>It just seems that
there's a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1546
02:10:12,449 --> 02:10:15,400
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Gimme a break.</i>

1547
02:10:15,994 --> 02:10:17,533
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

1548
02:10:18,038 --> 02:10:19,039
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

1549
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:21,162
<i>for the destruction
done to this city.</i>

1550
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:23,873
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

1551
02:10:24,002 --> 02:10:26,679
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1552
02:10:26,679 --> 02:10:27,753
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

1553
02:10:27,753 --> 02:10:29,465
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1554
02:10:29,592 --> 02:10:31,792
<i>What,
this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1555
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,003
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1556
02:10:39,727 --> 02:10:42,850
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

1557
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:44,357
<i>I would just...</i>

1558
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:47,472
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1559
02:10:50,405 --> 02:10:51,559
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1560
02:10:52,031 --> 02:10:54,078
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1561
02:10:54,576 --> 02:10:56,546
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1562
02:10:56,546 --> 02:10:57,736
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1563
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:00,544
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1564
02:11:01,249 --> 02:11:03,285
Out of our reach.

1565
02:11:03,710 --> 02:11:05,047
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1566
02:11:05,378 --> 02:11:08,682
I didn't make it.
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1567
02:11:08,682 --> 02:11:10,327
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1568
02:11:10,842 --> 02:11:12,316
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1569
02:11:12,316 --> 02:11:14,022
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

1570
02:11:14,234 --> 02:11:16,667
Oh, I think he will be.

1571
02:11:30,487 --> 02:11:32,935
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started,</i>

1572
02:11:33,282 --> 02:11:35,296
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

1573
02:11:36,285 --> 02:11:37,281
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1574
02:11:37,411 --> 02:11:40,885
They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.

1575
02:11:41,624 --> 02:11:43,966
Every world knows it.

1576
02:11:44,627 --> 02:11:46,410
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1577
02:11:46,837 --> 02:11:48,224
<i>A statement?</i>

1578
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,741
A promise.

1579
02:12:01,477 --> 02:12:02,732
Sir, how does it work now?

1580
02:12:04,147 --> 02:12:05,570
They've gone
their separate ways.

1581
02:12:06,274 --> 02:12:08,675
Some... pretty extremely far.

1582
02:12:09,945 --> 02:12:11,660
If we get into
a situation like this again,

1583
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:13,063
what happens then?

1584
02:12:13,657 --> 02:12:14,981
They'll come back.

1585
02:12:16,159 --> 02:12:18,749
- You really sure about that?
- I am.

1586
02:12:20,622 --> 02:12:21,864
Why?

1587
02:12:22,874 --> 02:12:24,761
Because we'll need them to.

1588
02:15:16,678 --> 02:15:19,465
<i>Humans.</i>

1589
02:15:20,473 --> 02:15:24,855
<i>They are not the cowering wretches
we were promised.</i>

1590
02:15:25,770 --> 02:15:27,679
<i>They stand.</i>

1591
02:15:28,773 --> 02:15:33,967
<i>They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.</i>

1592
02:15:42,204 --> 02:15:49,007
<i>To challenge them...
is to court... death.</i>

1593
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,088
