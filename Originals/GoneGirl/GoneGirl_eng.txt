1
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:24,405
When I think of my wife...

2
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,335
I always think of her head...

3
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:33,697
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

4
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:35,998
Unspooling her brains...

5
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:38,972
Trying to get answers...

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,380
The primal questions of any marriage.

7
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:45,765
 What are you thinking?

8
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:48,052
 How are you feeling?

9
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,726
 What have we done to each other?

10
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:29,704
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

11
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,496
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

12
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:36,994
I got you a present.

13
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:40,042
 I hated this game.
 You loved it.

14
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,373
You loved it.

15
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,708
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

16
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,674
Can you pour me a bourbon?

17
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,009
What's up, jitters?

18
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,067
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

19
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,484
With another excruciating story
by margo dunne.

20
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,194
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

21
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:09,245
 Changing Internet service providers.
 I like that one.

22
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:12,149
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

23
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,119
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

24
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,079
Who was also named Monica.

25
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,046
 Made it kind of interesting.
 It's great.

26
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:20,202
I'm just having a bad day.

27
00:03:20,248 --> 00:03:22,208
 Amy?
 It's our anniversary.

28
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,210
 Five years.
 Five?

29
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:25,422
That came fast.

30
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:26,792
And furious.

31
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:34,433
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

32
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:38,725
I met a boy.

33
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:43,197
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool ass guy.

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,730
Excuse me, miss?

35
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,235
I just want you to be careful...

36
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:51,076
Where you put down that
monk brewed Belgian wheat beer...

37
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,822
Because the party's down to three
beast lights and a bottle of pucker.

38
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,575
It might attract
some desperate characters.

39
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:58,457
It could.
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa.

40
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,081
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

41
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:08,006
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

42
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,006
 Meat ?

43
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,297
Yes,  meat.  One syllable.

44
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:13,302
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

45
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,633
Don't tell me.

46
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:16,973
Let's see, who's your type?

47
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,469
I don't see you sitting quietly...

48
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:22,105
While he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about proust.

49
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,444
Uh oh. Is that him?

50
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,689
Ironic hipster, so self aware,
he makes everything a joke.

51
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:29,982
I prefer men who are funny, not  funny.

52
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,150
What type are you?

53
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,656
Corn fed,
salt of the earth Missouri guy.

54
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:35,818
Missouri?

55
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:36,786
Cute.

56
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,165
 Native new yorker?
 The world ends at the Hudson.

57
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,282
What's your name?

58
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,288
Amy.

59
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,659
Well, Amy, who are you?

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,170
A, I'm an award winning scrimshander.

61
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:52,381
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

62
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:55,554
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

63
00:04:55,927 --> 00:05:00,137
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

64
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:03,432
And I happen to be a charter subscriber
to middling warlord weekly...

65
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,687
So I'd recognize you.

66
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,350
I'm gonna go with  c.

67
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:07,816
And you?

68
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,188
Who are you?

69
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:14,573
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

70
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:21,488
So, you write for a men's magazine.

71
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,796
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

72
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:25,911
No.

73
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,998
It's what to wear, what to drink.

74
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:30,003
How to bullshit.

75
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,635
Never with you.

76
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,501
Ha, ha.

77
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:34,167
No, I mean it.

78
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:36,016
It's hard to believe you.

79
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:36,841
Why?

80
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:38,515
I think it's your chin.

81
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:39,683
My chin?

82
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,391
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

83
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,062
Okay, how's this?

84
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,230
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

85
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:49,565
Okay.

86
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,196
We all move to New York...

87
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:55,363
And we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

88
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:58,863
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

89
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,034
You have to see this.

90
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:12,676
Hey.

91
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:13,672
Hey.

92
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,431
I have to kiss you now.

93
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:25,894
Is that right?

94
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:29,104
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

95
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,099
Wait a second.

96
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:36,278
There you go.

97
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,626
Nick dunne...

98
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,466
I really like you.

99
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,884
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

100
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,146
Treasure hunts?

101
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:06,181
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

102
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:09,184
What an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

103
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:10,307
Wow.

104
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,858
Life. I don't remember the point.

105
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,110
Deep hasbro thoughts.

106
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:18,482
Spin.

107
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,531
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

108
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,873
 When your poor Amy has a cold...

109
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,620
 This dessert just must be sold.

110
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,621
The answer?

111
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,452
I still don't know the answer, go.

112
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:31,658
 A few years ago, you'd have known.
 A few years ago, it was fun.

113
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,368
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

114
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,878
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

115
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:37,802
What did you get her?

116
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,209
A kite.

117
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,087
 She'd never flown a kite.
 Okay.

118
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:44,642
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

119
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,929
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

120
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,316
That's symbolic.

121
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,311
Yeah.

122
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:51,812
What's the gift for five?

123
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:52,643
Wood.

124
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,147
 So, what did you get her?
 There's no good gift for wood.

125
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,520
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

126
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,028
 There's some wood for you, bitch.

127
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,863
The bar.

128
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:08,037
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

129
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,238
Hey, it's watchful Wally.

130
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

131
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,999
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye bye.

132
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:33,896
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

133
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:36,605
Thanks, Walt!

134
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,659
Ame?

135
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,479
Amy!

136
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:28,818
Hello?

137
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,786
Come on in.

138
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:32,336
Hey.

139
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,790
 Mister dunne.
 Hi.

140
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,330
I'm detective Rhonda boney.
This is officer James gilpin.

141
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,334
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

142
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:42,296
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

143
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,130
Now, I don't panic easily...

144
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:48,548
But it's weird, right?

145
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:50,805
Mind if we look around?

146
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:51,976
Please.

147
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:53,265
How long have you two been here?

148
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:56,138
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

149
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,276
City?

150
00:09:57,312 --> 00:10:00,442
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

151
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,112
Why did you all move back here?

152
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,770
My mom got sick.

153
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,779
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

154
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,282
She's dead.

155
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,323
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,328
What do you do now, for work?

157
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,038
My sister margo and I
own the bar downtown.

158
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:22,342
Oh, the bar.

159
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,629
Love the name. Very meta.

160
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:25,763
Thanks.

161
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:30,508
Pretty things.

162
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,607
Stay.

163
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,393
My office, here.

164
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,479
Beautiful dress.

165
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:48,277
Date night?

166
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:49,571
It's our anniversary.

167
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:54,242
It's a guest bedroom, there.

168
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,166
Cat's room on the end.

169
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,754
I checked up here.

170
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,217
This is the kitchen...

171
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:04,593
Obviously.

172
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,193
This is my wife's office.

173
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,850
Amy's office.

174
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,952
Wow. Impressive gal.

175
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,208
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

176
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:42,419
I remember these.

177
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,918
I loved these books.

178
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,510
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,550
Your wife is amazing Amy?

180
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,476
Yeah. She is.

181
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,144
Wow.

182
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:03,773
Amazing fucking Amy
is getting fucking married.

183
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:05,604
That's how the night started.

184
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:11,739
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.

185
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,370
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

186
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,491
When I was 10, I quit cello.

187
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,127
In the next book,
amazing Amy became a prodigy.

188
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:25,374
Did you play volleyball?

189
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:27,507
I got cut, freshman year.

190
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,466
She made varsity.

191
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:32,882
When did you have a dog?

192
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:33,926
She got the dog.

193
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,053
Puddles made her more relatable.

194
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:38,437
Wow.

195
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,603
I love your parents...

196
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,432
But they really can be assholes.

197
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:43,927
 Nick!
 Sir!

198
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,769
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

199
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:46,604
No problem.

200
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,058
Hey, sweetheart.

201
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,070
Big night for your mom.

202
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,940
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

203
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,859
Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

204
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,777
People wanna hear from you.

205
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,456
 We can't stay long.
 Fantastic.

206
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:01,664
Fifteen minutes, tops.

207
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:06,297
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

208
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,964
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

209
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:13,054
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

210
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,301
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

211
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:16,803
I thought that would be creepy.

212
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:19,305
 If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing

213
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,677
hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

214
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:23,525
You're very cute, Nick.

215
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,180
Amy, you know
what would make dad's night.

216
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:26,848
I'm on it.

217
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:31,148
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

218
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:32,443
I'm curious whether...

219
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,196
It's difficult for you to see
amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

220
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:37,661
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

221
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:40,029
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

222
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,746
Is that correct?

223
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:46,464
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

224
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,330
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

225
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:51,632
It's you.

226
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,211
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

227
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:57,838
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick dunne for how long?

228
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:00,686
 Two magical years.
 Two magical years.

229
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,562
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

230
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,059
To perform such gracious gestures as...

231
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:09,021
Not correcting Nick when he
pronounced  quinoa  as  kween o a.

232
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,524
An understandable mistake.

233
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:11,735
He also thought it was a fish.

234
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,365
He thinks velveeta is a cheese.

235
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,692
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

236
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:19,318
When Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

237
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,576
Of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

238
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:23,658
[S]These bag of bone shoes

239
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:24,873
that's just frightening.

240
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,543
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

241
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,252
And matching stapler.

242
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:32,212
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.

243
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:35,764
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un snobby.

244
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,429
You challenge me. You surprise me.

245
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:40,799
And, fun fact for the readers...

246
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,931
You have a world class vagina.

247
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:48,065
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

248
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,393
Is that correct?

249
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:51,898
I'm not.

250
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,270
Isn't it time we fixed that?

251
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,404
And then...

252
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:59,284
The night wasn't so bad anymore.

253
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,130
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

254
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:22,135
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

255
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,589
But given the scene at your house...

256
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,758
And given our spike
in violent crime of late...

257
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:28,267
We are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

258
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,270
Okay. Good.

259
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:32,601
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

260
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,227
 I could stay at my sister's.
 Okay.

261
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:36,574
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

262
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,280
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

263
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
 We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
 You're having a press conference?

264
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,954
I wanna get the word out, right?

265
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:47,281
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.

266
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,507
Time is of the essence in these cases.

267
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:00,297
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

268
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,472
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

269
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,300
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

270
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:06,605
 You tend bar  
 I own the bar.

271
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,140
And I teach creative writing at mvcc.

272
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,985
 No kids?
 Not yet.

273
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,480
So, what does Amy do most days?

274
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,732
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

275
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,653
I don't know. She keeps busy.

276
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,192
Doing what?

277
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,034
She's a voracious reader.

278
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,913
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

279
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,453
Well, days can get long.

280
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:32,335
I know a few housewives, that
evening glass of wine starts coming at noon.

281
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:33,664
Or prescription pills.

282
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,208
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

283
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,712
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some oxycontin.

284
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,844
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

285
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,381
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

286
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:43,844
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

287
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,725
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

288
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:49,012
No, not really.

289
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:51,017
No friends? This whole town?

290
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,689
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

291
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,559
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

292
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:58,018
In our neighborhood.

293
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,938
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

294
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,403
We'll look into that.

295
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:05,075
You got to the bar around 11:00 today.

296
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:06,705
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

297
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,701
Well, I was home.

298
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:10,372
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

299
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,042
I went to Sawyer beach
and read the news.

300
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,250
Did you visit with anyone there?

301
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,251
I kind of go to Sawyer beach
for the solitude.

302
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,999
So, your wife has no friends here.

303
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:21,886
Is she kinda standoffish?

304
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,343
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

305
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:25,884
She's from New York.

306
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:30,393
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

307
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,262
Type a?

308
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,180
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

309
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:37,057
You seem pretty laid back. Type b.

310
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:39,275
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

311
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:41,616
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

312
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:44,441
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

313
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,398
And you don't know
your wife's blood type.

314
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,568
Sure you all are married?

315
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,286
Maybe it's type o.

316
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,547
 Where are her folks? New York?
 Yeah.

317
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,289
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

318
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:56,371
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

319
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,256
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

320
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,713
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

321
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:03,214
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

322
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,466
Fine.

323
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,931
Should I know my wife's blood type?

324
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:12,973
No.

325
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:17,098
I apologize, marybeth.
I didn't know what was going on.

326
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,645
Now I'm at the station...

327
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:22,188
And the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

328
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,861
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

329
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,164
I'm standing right next to
detective Rhonda boney...

330
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,159
Who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

331
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,581
My mother in law
would like to speak with you.

332
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,288
This is detective boney.

333
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,673
I wanna go home.

334
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,169
I don't know why I have to be here.

335
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,842
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

336
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,011
Dad?

337
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,014
This is my father. What's going on?

338
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,091
Really? You're Nick dunne?

339
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,344
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

340
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:53,048
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

341
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,218
 Bitch.
 Don't.

342
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,646
Your father wandered out of comfort hill
after lunch.

343
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:59,065
We found him walking route 79,
disoriented.

344
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,564
We've been trying to call you
for the last

345
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,855
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

346
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,858
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

347
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,822
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

348
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:06,981
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

349
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:08,568
Dad, stop.

350
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,451
You wanna drive him home?

351
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,408
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

352
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,063
This voice mailbox is currently full.

353
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:39,887
Fuck.

354
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,695
Get your fucking hands off me.

355
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,113
Thanks.

356
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:03,084
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

357
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,716
Marriage is hard work.

358
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,804
And compromise and more work.

359
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,090
 Abandon all hope, ye who enter.

360
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:14,054
 When young Amy's hope did wane...

361
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,435
 She wandered here...

362
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:17,972
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

363
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,646
 ...in search of Jane.

364
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:23,605
With us, two years...

365
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,275
It's just good.

366
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,614
Austen.

367
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,110
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

368
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,615
Look at that.

369
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:38,832
My God.

370
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:40,619
You naughty minx.

371
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:43,754
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

372
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,422
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

373
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,960
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

374
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,715
God bless Jane Austen.

375
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:10,074
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

376
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:15,319
Thank you.

377
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:17,826
Year two. Cotton.

378
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,833
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

379
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,339
So, these are 2,000 thread count

380
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,306
we're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

381
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:42,557
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

382
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:45,479
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

383
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,690
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

384
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,150
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

385
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:51,362
You know, they asked...

386
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,153
Why didn't she have any friends?

387
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,035
What did you say?

388
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,070
 I said she was complicated.
 Nick!

389
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,703
Everyone knows  complicated 
is code for  bitch.

390
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,913
God. I feel sick.

391
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,368
Thanks.

392
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:10,667
It's so bizarre.

393
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:13,212
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

394
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:14,426
She always attracts

395
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,056
drama?

396
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,265
You can say it. It's just me and you.

397
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,853
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

398
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:22,139
Doesn't mean I don't care about her.

399
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,397
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

400
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:38,778
Detective? Excuse me.

401
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,454
I'm noelle hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

402
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:45,237
Well, great. Where do you live, noelle?

403
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,289
Five doors down. 1032.

404
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,542
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

405
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,464
Can I come by in half an hour?

406
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,213
 Y'all know anything yet?
 I'm sorry.

407
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:56,055
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

408
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,421
But that's usually bath time.

409
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,766
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

410
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,815
All right. So, what do you got?

411
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,480
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

412
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:09,638
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

413
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,058
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

414
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,737
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

415
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:14,945
Well, okay.

416
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:18,744
Interesting.

417
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,900
What's that?

418
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:23,448
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

419
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,623
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

420
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:28,503
Even his bar's in her name.

421
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,460
I don't know that that's so surprising.

422
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,120
No. But it is humiliating.

423
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:33,079
What you got?

424
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,958
It's with her unmentionables.

425
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,190
Well, we have our first clue.

426
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:03,952
I have to take a shower.

427
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:05,782
No, don't. You've been up all night.

428
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,987
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

429
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:11,963
Hey, be careful today, okay?

430
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,330
That's a weird thing to say.

431
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:17,136
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like

432
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,672
please don't say,  like dad.

433
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:21,475
Or else you swing into your momma's boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

434
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,300
Perfect.

435
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,094
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

436
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:26,968
Okay. Just be...

437
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:28,935
Myself?

438
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:31,315
...sponsoring a raffle to
benefit west county 4h...

439
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:34,813
And raffling season tickets for
mizzou football.

440
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:38,156
Buy your tickets at the wing hut or
local tri state tire stores.

441
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,069
Your in laws made it.

442
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:47,126
 Hi, rand.
 Hey, man.

443
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,990
I'm detective boney.

444
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,996
I'm the twin. Margo.

445
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:53,118
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

446
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,506
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

447
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,333
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

448
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:57,498
We didn't have a lot of choice.

449
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:01,216
We are all worried. We are all scared.

450
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:05,718
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

451
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,859
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

452
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:18,859
Good.

453
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:24,867
As you know, my wife,
Amy elliott dunne...

454
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:27,706
Disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

455
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,200
Under suspicious circumstances.

456
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:32,706
Louder!

457
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:37,167
If anyone out there
has any information...

458
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,540
Please come forward.

459
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:41,208
Thank you.

460
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,380
I'm rand elliott.
My wife, marybeth elliott.

461
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,508
Should I have said my name?

462
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,056
Amy is our only child.

463
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:54,098
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

464
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:56,103
She really is amazing Amy.

465
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:59,148
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

466
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,731
Who grew up with her and care about her.

467
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,406
We care about her, we love her.

468
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:07,703
And we just want her back.

469
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:12,238
Amy is a decorated scholar.

470
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:15,257
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

471
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,580
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

472
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,966
And she made a life in her adopted home.

473
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,426
Now, Amy needs your help.

474
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:27,595
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the drury lodge.

475
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:32,976
We have a hotline, 1 855 4 Amy tips.

476
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:38,645
And our website is
www.Findamazingamy.Com.

477
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:41,107
 Mr. dunne!
 Mr. elliott!

478
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:44,324
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play?

479
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,741
Mr. elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

480
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,243
Smile.

481
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,424
That's all for now. Thank you.

482
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:05,844
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

483
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:06,762
Right, Nick?

484
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,970
Yeah, definitely.

485
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,509
And we've had instances...

486
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:12,604
 Where things got  
 scary.

487
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:14,099
Do you know about desi collings?

488
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:15,811
Yeah, I know all about desi collings.

489
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,101
He was obsessed.

490
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:20,484
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

491
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,062
We had to file a restraining order.

492
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,487
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

493
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:27,746
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.

494
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,649
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

495
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,318
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

496
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:33,576
This is only eight years ago,
in New York.

497
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,908
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

498
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,624
 She filed charges.
 What was the charge?

499
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,754
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

500
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,751
I only know it was bad.

501
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,583
 I didn't know this.
 Okay.

502
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,538
Thank you.

503
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:46,879
Anything more recent?

504
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,218
Not that I know of.

505
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,601
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

506
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,388
Yeah.

507
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:07,155
Imagine our confusion.

508
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,364
A missing persons case...

509
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,993
And in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked  clue.

510
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:13,281
That's for our anniversary.

511
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,625
My wife does these treasure hunts.

512
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,040
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

513
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,079
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

514
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,708
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

515
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:24,212
Of course. Okay.

516
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:26,842
 Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

517
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:30,299
 It's a cozy room
for my favorite writer.

518
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:34,346
I know this one!

519
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,356
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

520
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:41,775
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

521
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,691
After school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

522
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:49,653
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

523
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,028
Well, well. What does it say?

524
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:57,586
Clue two.

525
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:02,083
 Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

526
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:06,462
 You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover.

527
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,002
 Let's head on over...

528
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,926
 To the little brown house.

529
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:13,675
 We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse.

530
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,471
These yours?

531
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:19,348
No.

532
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,851
But you read the first clue.

533
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,022
Randy Professor, naughty student.

534
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,102
I blush.

535
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:26,907
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

536
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:29,478
Where's this little brown house?

537
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,036
I have no idea.

538
00:30:14,237 --> 00:30:15,607
Hello?

539
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,161
Nicholas dunne.

540
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:21,915
Under my father's name, William dunne.

541
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:32,425
My wife's first pet? Is this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell

542
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,424
yeah, I know.

543
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,095
It's... it's...

544
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:39,842
It's  puddles,  right?
Or is it  poodles?

545
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,397
We're good.

546
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,098
Hello, stranger.

547
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,276
Fancy meeting you here.

548
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,615
It's your dad's house, right?

549
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,281
Are you following me?

550
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,189
What you doing?

551
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:57,407
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

552
00:30:57,447 --> 00:31:00,157
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

553
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,242
But it looks okay.

554
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,875
I'll walk you out.

555
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,625
You know...

556
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,919
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

557
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:15,174
From the clue.

558
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:17,175
Nope. Still blue.

559
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,860
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

560
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:41,614
I need to be punished,
and by  punished,  I mean  had.

561
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:45,247
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

562
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:49,297
 So open the door, and look alive.

563
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:51,624
Bitch!

564
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:58,338
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

565
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,469
Add one recession...

566
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,092
Subtract two jobs.

567
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:04,799
It's surprisingly effective.

568
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:07,258
Promise me we'll never be like them.

569
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,429
Like who?

570
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,237
All those awful couples we know.

571
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,230
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

572
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:15,734
To be trained and paraded.

573
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,069
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

574
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:22,036
To be out foxed and avoided.

575
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:28,456
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

576
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,037
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

577
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,293
I'll probably be next.

578
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:35,586
We have each other.

579
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,502
Everything else is background noise.

580
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,381
You are exceptional.

581
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,350
My turn.

582
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:55,689
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

583
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:56,562
That's terrible.

584
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,028
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

585
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,569
How much?

586
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,822
Almost a million.

587
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:04,996
That's almost all of it.

588
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,333
This is where you say,
 everything else is background noise.

589
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,279
Amy, if you're laid off...

590
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:09,828
And I'm laid off...

591
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,001
I said I'd do it.

592
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,289
Without talking to me?

593
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:13,912
 Well, it's...
 Your call.

594
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,539
...their money, technically.

595
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,635
You know what? You're right.

596
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,259
Everything else
is just background noise.

597
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,228
Hey.

598
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:39,518
More games?

599
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,188
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

600
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:43,864
What's the laptop for?

601
00:33:44,948 --> 00:33:45,948
Laptop ing.

602
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,121
I see.

603
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,161
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

604
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:55,336
But God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

605
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,425
You are spending a lot.

606
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:58,709
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

607
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,293
You certainly don't trust my intention.

608
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,298
What are you talking about?

609
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,959
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

610
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,258
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

611
00:34:05,302 --> 00:34:06,842
Because it's easy to throw.

612
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:07,687
Nick, I don't get it.

613
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:11,061
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

614
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:14,179
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

615
00:34:14,227 --> 00:34:16,597
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

616
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:17,816
I'm sorry.

617
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,196
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

618
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,233
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

619
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,287
You'll get another job.

620
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,910
Hi, go.

621
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:33,411
What? Hold on. What?

622
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:34,875
 And suddenly...
 Slow down, what is it?

623
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:36,915
...I knew everything
was about to get worse.

624
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,538
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

625
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,404
 Bless you, Nick.
 Father.

626
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,493
Hey, tom. Mayor!

627
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:10,783
Nick, good to see you.

628
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:11,826
Good to see you.

629
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,118
Hey, guys, hey.

630
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,039
 Jodie.
 Nick.

631
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,370
Oh, we'll find her.

632
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,060
You look like hammered shit.

633
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,772
Thank you.

634
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:48,322
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

635
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,989
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

636
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:53,823
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

637
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:54,909
Do gooders?

638
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,163
Freaks.

639
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,164
Hey, I meant to ask you.

640
00:35:58,206 --> 00:35:59,666
Noelle hawthorne?

641
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,252
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

642
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,708
I've never heard the name
noelle hawthorne.

643
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:06,924
She and her husband have triplets.

644
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:07,845
Oh.

645
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:11,088
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

646
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,640
But  best friend ? No.

647
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:15,391
Excuse me, one sec.

648
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:21,776
He acted like
noelle was a complete stranger.

649
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,903
Of course he did.

650
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:24,563
Look, these two are yours.

651
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:26,978
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

652
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:28,947
So everybody can see him
being a good guy.

653
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,777
You really don't like him, do you?

654
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,322
What's to like?

655
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:57,642
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to

656
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,062
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's shawna Kelly.

657
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:04,021
I am so sorry for your troubles.

658
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:04,984
Thank you. That's kind.

659
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,443
Are you remembering to eat?

660
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:07,613
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

661
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:11,821
I'm gonna fix you up
my world famous chicken frito pie.

662
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,363
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

663
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:15,036
You have to keep your strength.

664
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,535
Would you...

665
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,332
Say,  chicken frito pie!

666
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,832
You know what?

667
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:27,466
Would you delete that picture for me?

668
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:29,384
 It's a nice photo.
 I know it is.

669
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:30,842
But just do me a favor.

670
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,632
Will you?

671
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:35,596
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

672
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:36,297
You just press...

673
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,180
What is wrong with you?

674
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,513
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

675
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,888
I will share it with whomever I please.

676
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,060
 Dude.
 Yeah?

677
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:49,438
Marybeth is pissed.

678
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:50,942
Why?

679
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:55,402
Marybeth?

680
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:58,868
It's like you're the goddamn
homecoming king.

681
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:03,748
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

682
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,710
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

683
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,460
It looked like you were having fun.

684
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,752
I am in a nightmare!

685
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:12,883
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

686
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:16,634
To the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

687
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,357
You're right.

688
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:23,184
And I'm sorry.

689
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:28,817
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

690
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,124
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

691
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:44,583
No.

692
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:47,417
How about a brand new stratocaster?

693
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,579
No, nothing like that.

694
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:51,384
Well, all right.

695
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:59,434
How big's that TV? It's not 65 inch.

696
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,761
No, it's nowhere near that.

697
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:01,896
Okay.

698
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:03,759
 Kibble?
 Excuse me?

699
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,889
He asked me to feed his cat.

700
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,146
I saw some in the pantry.

701
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:12,229
Detective boney, officer gilpin?
Noelle hawthorne!

702
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:13,865
I know y'all are in there!

703
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:18,402
Would you please escort miss hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

704
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:21,372
Detective boney!

705
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:25,239
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

706
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:38,804
Look at that pie eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

707
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,179
 How are you doing?
 Terrific.

708
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,446
How's marybeth?

709
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:51,309
She's a wreck.

710
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,816
And you?

711
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,071
Awesome.

712
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,070
Hey...

713
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:57,691
Have you told me everything?

714
00:39:57,946 --> 00:39:58,906
Of course.

715
00:39:58,947 --> 00:39:59,907
Everything?

716
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,108
Why would you even ask me that?

717
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:05,328
Ever since you walked into the bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

718
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:07,621
 Off.
 I am off.

719
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:12,005
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

720
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:15,463
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

721
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:16,845
And not be judged.

722
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:18,382
Can we do that?

723
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:20,798
Of course.

724
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:24,179
You know what I keep thinking?

725
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,262
If mom were here?

726
00:40:25,307 --> 00:40:28,727
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

727
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:32,987
Nick, mom would fix it.

728
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:43,417
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

729
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:48,658
 Love you.
 Love you.

730
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,041
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

731
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:58,556
I am a missourian.

732
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:06,727
Bye, dad.

733
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:12,102
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

734
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:14,315
And then, we heard from go.

735
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:16,276
Mama Maureen...

736
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:19,156
Stage 4 breast cancer.

737
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:24,161
So, we moved to Missouri.

738
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,819
I don't mind.

739
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:29,037
I just wish he'd asked.

740
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:43,175
Nick is happy to be home.

741
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:45,718
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

742
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:50,472
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

743
00:41:50,517 --> 00:41:53,687
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

744
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:55,938
Something disposable.

745
00:41:57,774 --> 00:42:00,404
I feel like I could disappear.

746
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:46,404
Oh, my God!

747
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:48,408
 I saw you on TV.
 Okay.

748
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,120
 It's so crazy.
 Yeah, I know.

749
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,370
 She just vanished?
 She's just gone.

750
00:42:52,412 --> 00:42:54,252
 I've been so worried about you.
 Where have you been?

751
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,119
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

752
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,216
Rehearsals.

753
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,290
What?

754
00:42:58,335 --> 00:42:59,635
Godspell.

755
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:03,053
My sister's asleep in the other room.

756
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:04,209
I needed to see you.

757
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:05,917
I know this is a bad idea.

758
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:07,467
Can you at least tell me you love me?

759
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:11,261
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

760
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:12,566
I've been so scared.

761
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,809
Between rehearsals?

762
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,600
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

763
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:17,144
I know.

764
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:18,447
We need to stop.

765
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,650
I need you.

766
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:22,614
Touch me.

767
00:43:26,029 --> 00:43:28,649
Stop it. Come here.

768
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:31,743
Sit down.

769
00:43:31,785 --> 00:43:33,125
Okay.

770
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:37,251
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

771
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,790
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

772
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:41,634
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

773
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,590
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

774
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,510
I know, sweetie.
Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office?

775
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:49,970
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

776
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:50,971
Sweetheart, think.

777
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:53,472
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

778
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:56,145
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

779
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,984
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

780
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:59,479
Until when?

781
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:01,481
Until it's safe.

782
00:44:01,523 --> 00:44:03,113
You were going to get a divorce.

783
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,320
Never say that out loud again.

784
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,030
Okay. I'm sorry.

785
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:09,865
I don't wanna fight.

786
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,488
I just wanna be with you.

787
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:14,705
Andie, please...

788
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:17,207
That's all I want.

789
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,620
I can't.

790
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,210
It's our last time together.

791
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:26,304
Let's make the most of it.

792
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:36,394
Real quick, but then you have to go.

793
00:44:39,227 --> 00:44:42,017
My husband has come undone.

794
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:45,023
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

795
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:47,786
But as it turns out, we couldn't.

796
00:44:51,072 --> 00:44:52,822
It means a lot that you came.

797
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,372
We took a hit on the brownstone...

798
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,740
And I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

799
00:44:58,497 --> 00:45:00,757
So far, it's just costing money.

800
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:08,751
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

801
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:14,437
Otherwise, I don't exist.

802
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,760
We should go to outback tonight.

803
00:45:17,808 --> 00:45:19,058
That would be nice.

804
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,180
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

805
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:26,274
I became someone I don't even like.

806
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,116
The kind of woman I used to mock.

807
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:30,237
You're out so much.

808
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:32,608
 I know.
 Stay home.

809
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:34,996
 I can't, I'm already late.
 Then, can I come?

810
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,823
You would hate it.

811
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:40,118
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

812
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:44,002
Do our code. No bullshit.

813
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:46,829
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

814
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:55,183
Okay, bye.

815
00:45:56,847 --> 00:45:59,817
 Hey, I've been thinking.
 Yeah?

816
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,220
Something positive.

817
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:03,684
Maybe it's time.

818
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,810
Now is literally the worst time.

819
00:46:06,857 --> 00:46:07,907
It would be a new start for us.

820
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:11,036
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

821
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,279
A child is not a hobby.

822
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Not a hobby.

823
00:46:14,322 --> 00:46:15,532
An inspiration.

824
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:19,204
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

825
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,494
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

826
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:23,957
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

827
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,999
 Save ?

828
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,670
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

829
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:29,881
 And you're gonna walk out the door now?
 Yeah!

830
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:32,461
You're a fucking coward.

831
00:46:32,507 --> 00:46:34,377
No, it can't go on like this.

832
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:35,476
Really?

833
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,010
 I won't.
 You won't?

834
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:39,393
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

835
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:40,351
It's not even close!

836
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,520
You stupid bitch!

837
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:46,061
What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.

838
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:49,944
What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.

839
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,365
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

840
00:46:53,361 --> 00:46:57,031
I am frightened of my own husband.

841
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:10,419
You want me to call for backup?

842
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:12,552
Nah, I'll protect you.

843
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,725
Jesus.

844
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,440
They ought to burn this place down.

845
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:31,558
Seems like folks are trying.

846
00:47:37,072 --> 00:47:39,362
You really think this is anything?

847
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:41,567
Cross it off the list.

848
00:47:52,671 --> 00:47:54,381
Hey, Jason.

849
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:55,962
What's up, Rhonda?

850
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,257
 ...and dedicated to the proposition
that all men...

851
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,844
 Have you seen this girl around here?
 Why do you ask?

852
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:03,937
She was reported missing.

853
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:08,982
 ...and so dedicated, can long endure.

854
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,940
Yeah. I remember her.

855
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:13,111
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

856
00:48:14,776 --> 00:48:15,786
She wanted a gun.

857
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,067
I told her it's not my thing.

858
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:21,113
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

859
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:24,738
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

860
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:26,626
Are you sure this is her?

861
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:28,793
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

862
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:31,291
She was all in pink.

863
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:33,884
It was Valentine's day.

864
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,590
For Valentine's day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

865
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:42,224
That is how crazy I've become.

866
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:47,435
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

867
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:51,606
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

868
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:53,156
The bitch with the prenup.

869
00:48:54,983 --> 00:48:57,323
I could go home to my parents...

870
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,780
But I'd have to tell them the truth.

871
00:48:59,821 --> 00:49:03,661
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

872
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,490
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

873
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,500
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

874
00:49:10,832 --> 00:49:11,502
It's just...

875
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:15,332
I'd sleep better with a gun.

876
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:27,643
Oh, shit.

877
00:49:27,682 --> 00:49:31,312
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

878
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,900
 Sorry to rush you.
 It's okay.

879
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:41,361
 Here. Let me help you.
 Okay.

880
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:43,494
Just get that.

881
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:47,659
Be very careful.

882
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:49,495
I'm all right.

883
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:52,118
Here you go.

884
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:54,045
Promise me we'll talk every day.

885
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:55,334
Okay, we will.

886
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:58,097
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

887
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,960
Don't go crazy.

888
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:01,266
Okay.

889
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,009
You fucking idiot.

890
00:50:09,057 --> 00:50:12,887
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

891
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:15,946
I'm sorry.

892
00:50:17,732 --> 00:50:18,692
How old is she?

893
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:20,267
She's in her early 20s.

894
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:22,034
How long?

895
00:50:22,737 --> 00:50:25,527
 A year and a half.
 You lied to me for over a year?

896
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:27,244
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

897
00:50:27,284 --> 00:50:28,874
It's so fucking small.

898
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,870
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like dad!

899
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:33,203
How did you even meet her?

900
00:50:33,248 --> 00:50:34,458
She's one of my students.

901
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:37,379
I thought writers hated clichés.

902
00:50:37,419 --> 00:50:38,249
I'm not a writer.

903
00:50:38,295 --> 00:50:40,545
 Boo hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager.

904
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:43,379
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

905
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:45,345
How fucking terrible she made me feel.

906
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:48,555
Flyover boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

907
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:50,437
Just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

908
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:52,604
Dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

909
00:50:52,642 --> 00:50:54,062
This is so bad.

910
00:50:54,102 --> 00:50:56,192
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

911
00:50:56,229 --> 00:50:58,849
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

912
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,439
Where, occasionally, Andie and I...

913
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:02,021
I don't know what the fuck it means.

914
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:03,228
Are they super twat's?

915
00:51:03,278 --> 00:51:05,358
Her name is Andie.

916
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:06,905
She's not entirely sure.

917
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,608
So we are dealing with a 20 year old...

918
00:51:08,658 --> 00:51:10,068
Who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

919
00:51:10,118 --> 00:51:12,368
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

920
00:51:12,412 --> 00:51:14,122
And she left them there for me to find.

921
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:17,924
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

922
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:20,249
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

923
00:51:20,295 --> 00:51:23,425
And this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

924
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:24,635
Can you imagine?

925
00:51:25,258 --> 00:51:28,588
Have you watched television lately?

926
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:31,647
Cable news is all over your shit.

927
00:51:32,265 --> 00:51:34,105
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

928
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:36,432
His wife's nowhere to be found...

929
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:40,148
And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

930
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,650
 Who is that?
 Some fucking tragedy groupie.

931
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:44,612
 Who the fuck is that?
 I don't know.

932
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:45,783
She was trying to give me a casserole.

933
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,951
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...

934
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,530
Patron Saint to wife killers everywhere.

935
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:55,337
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick dunne?

936
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:56,502
Well, let me just say...

937
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,290
As always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

938
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:00,884
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.

939
00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:03,669
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

940
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:05,133
That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

941
00:52:05,173 --> 00:52:08,513
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

942
00:52:08,552 --> 00:52:10,512
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

943
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:12,802
To behave normally in this situation...

944
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:15,598
Because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

945
00:52:15,642 --> 00:52:18,312
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

946
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:20,603
Is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

947
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:23,307
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

948
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:26,573
You need to hire Tanner bolt.

949
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:29,455
I don't deserve this.

950
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:31,359
Innocent until proven guilty.

951
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:33,778
That's exactly what you deserve.

952
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:35,377
Go home, Nick.

953
00:53:01,354 --> 00:53:02,774
Hey, buddy.

954
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,453
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

955
00:53:20,499 --> 00:53:22,459
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

956
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:24,001
Just because some blonde dunce says so.

957
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:26,919
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

958
00:53:27,214 --> 00:53:30,554
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch hunt.

959
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:32,512
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

960
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:33,842
She was trying to buy a gun.

961
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:36,057
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, gil.

962
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:37,007
Give me the update.

963
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,219
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

964
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:42,228
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

965
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,980
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten,
so cross that off the list.

966
00:53:45,023 --> 00:53:46,193
 Hey.
 Hey.

967
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:49,653
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

968
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:50,994
 Whoa.
 Yeah.

969
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:52,149
The blood is profuse.

970
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:54,417
It is Amy's, type b,
and we should have DNA soon.

971
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:55,529
Thoughts on a weapon?

972
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:57,495
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

973
00:53:57,536 --> 00:53:59,876
Maybe a club or a two by four.

974
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:03,715
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

975
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,170
Amy's medical records come in?

976
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,210
No, we'll have them later tonight.

977
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:10,217
My wife says he's a killer.

978
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:12,805
Well, if Tiffany says...

979
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,410
Hey.

980
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:40,744
Hey.

981
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,177
Thank you all for coming out.

982
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:49,633
Hey Donnie, how are you?

983
00:54:49,671 --> 00:54:53,011
Rich, thank you so much.

984
00:55:00,307 --> 00:55:01,317
Hey.

985
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:11,946
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

986
00:55:11,985 --> 00:55:13,785
It just means the world to our family.

987
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:15,781
And to Amy.

988
00:55:16,364 --> 00:55:18,364
As you all know...

989
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:22,491
My wife, Amy elliott dunne...

990
00:55:22,537 --> 00:55:24,037
Disappeared three days ago.

991
00:55:24,623 --> 00:55:28,173
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

992
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,130
Please come forward. Help us.

993
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:32,091
So hot.

994
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,500
He is so creepy.

995
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:37,008
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

996
00:55:37,052 --> 00:55:38,972
And are too polite to ask.

997
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:42,561
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

998
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:45,101
I'm cooperating with the police.

999
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:47,183
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1000
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:48,349
I have nothing to hide.

1001
00:55:49,648 --> 00:55:52,148
Amy is my soul mate.

1002
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,690
She is brilliant...

1003
00:55:54,236 --> 00:55:57,326
She's charming, and wise.

1004
00:55:57,656 --> 00:55:59,366
I love you, Amy.

1005
00:56:03,495 --> 00:56:04,585
Asshole.

1006
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:07,834
I love my wife...

1007
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,418
So much.

1008
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,260
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1009
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:19,885
And if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1010
00:56:19,928 --> 00:56:23,638
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1011
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:26,722
But don't harass
the people of this town.

1012
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:28,808
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1013
00:56:28,854 --> 00:56:30,064
Nick!

1014
00:56:30,105 --> 00:56:31,775
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1015
00:56:32,274 --> 00:56:33,864
Where's your wife, Nick?

1016
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,400
Let the police do their jobs.

1017
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:37,441
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1018
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,531
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1019
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:42,624
Did you tell them
Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1020
00:56:46,371 --> 00:56:48,541
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1021
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:52,119
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1022
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:57,803
Gil, go, go.

1023
00:57:00,135 --> 00:57:01,265
Nick, where are you going?

1024
00:57:01,303 --> 00:57:02,893
Stop him!

1025
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:05,139
No questions right now. Thank you.

1026
00:57:07,642 --> 00:57:09,182
Why are you running away?

1027
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,690
Don't run.

1028
00:57:12,772 --> 00:57:13,772
Everybody, stay back.

1029
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,740
Guys, come on. You know better.

1030
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,240
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1031
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:24,703
 Hey, gil...
 On it.

1032
00:57:24,743 --> 00:57:25,783
All right.

1033
00:57:25,827 --> 00:57:27,617
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1034
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:28,952
Hello?

1035
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:31,256
Hello?

1036
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:32,121
Fuck.

1037
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,677
You scared me. Want a drink?

1038
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:35,210
Did you know she was pregnant?

1039
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:37,383
I told you,
noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1040
00:57:37,422 --> 00:57:38,462
She doesn't even know Amy.

1041
00:57:39,132 --> 00:57:40,552
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1042
00:57:48,308 --> 00:57:51,728
Look, I don't know.
But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1043
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:52,980
We have her medical records coming.

1044
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:54,901
 Good.
 So, let's talk while we wait.

1045
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,150
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1046
00:57:57,192 --> 00:58:00,072
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1047
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:02,071
Dozens and dozens.

1048
00:58:02,113 --> 00:58:04,323
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1049
00:58:04,366 --> 00:58:07,536
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1050
00:58:09,454 --> 00:58:12,874
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life and death struggle?

1051
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,041
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1052
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:16,715
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1053
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:17,713
No.

1054
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:20,004
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1055
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:22,718
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1056
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:25,009
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1057
00:58:25,053 --> 00:58:26,013
Oh, my God.

1058
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:27,394
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1059
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,890
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1060
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:31,523
If they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1061
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,310
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1062
00:58:34,354 --> 00:58:36,774
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1063
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:38,235
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1064
00:58:38,275 --> 00:58:41,365
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1065
00:58:41,403 --> 00:58:43,403
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1066
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:46,166
 Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
 I see.

1067
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:49,159
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is noelle.

1068
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:50,742
She says,  not good.

1069
00:58:50,787 --> 00:58:52,287
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1070
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,460
 What pisses you off?
 Money, lack thereof.

1071
00:58:54,499 --> 00:58:56,249
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1072
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:59,633
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1073
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:02,381
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1074
00:59:02,424 --> 00:59:04,384
 What?
 I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1075
00:59:04,426 --> 00:59:06,436
There are these fun little splurges.

1076
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,010
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1077
00:59:08,054 --> 00:59:09,184
I don't even golf!

1078
00:59:09,222 --> 00:59:10,552
I do! You bought great clubs.

1079
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:11,889
I like the robot dog.

1080
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,893
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1081
00:59:13,935 --> 00:59:14,895
We need to find out who did this!

1082
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:16,696
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1083
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,270
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1084
00:59:19,316 --> 00:59:20,316
To $1.2 million.

1085
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:22,728
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1086
00:59:22,777 --> 00:59:23,937
You filed the paperwork.

1087
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:25,187
Because she told me to!

1088
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:26,951
Hold on a sec.

1089
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,780
Yeah? Okay.

1090
00:59:30,702 --> 00:59:31,872
For sure?

1091
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:33,457
All right.

1092
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:38,502
She was pregnant.

1093
00:59:42,631 --> 00:59:44,261
This is insane.

1094
00:59:44,299 --> 00:59:46,799
So, my question becomes

1095
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:49,763
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1096
00:59:49,805 --> 00:59:50,975
Without a lawyer.

1097
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:00,314
Margo!

1098
01:00:11,201 --> 01:00:12,201
Hey.

1099
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,999
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1100
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,960
Nick?

1101
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:20,789
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as

1102
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:24,676
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1103
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:28,220
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't

1104
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,850
you want to know the truth?

1105
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:35,259
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1106
01:00:37,686 --> 01:00:39,736
Well, I'm as surprised as

1107
01:00:41,064 --> 01:00:42,864
you told me you didn't want kids.

1108
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:45,229
I was trying to put a good face on.

1109
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:47,157
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1110
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:48,535
That's a problem for you.

1111
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:51,662
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1112
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,160
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!

1113
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:54,531
You have to fucking talk to me!

1114
01:00:57,205 --> 01:01:01,255
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1115
01:01:01,293 --> 01:01:03,503
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1116
01:01:03,545 --> 01:01:05,425
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just

1117
01:01:05,463 --> 01:01:07,673
 lie to me?
 I wanted kids!

1118
01:01:07,716 --> 01:01:09,886
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1119
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:11,596
 It didn't work?
 I did my part!

1120
01:01:11,636 --> 01:01:12,686
Masturbate.

1121
01:01:12,721 --> 01:01:14,431
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1122
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:16,013
 Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks.

1123
01:01:16,057 --> 01:01:18,057
Now, who would believe you?

1124
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:20,427
All right.

1125
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:31,861
This is a letter from the clinic...

1126
01:01:31,907 --> 01:01:34,377
Notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1127
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:36,409
Unless I contact them.

1128
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:39,202
So, I gave it to Amy.

1129
01:01:39,247 --> 01:01:42,247
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1130
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:43,872
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1131
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:46,749
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1132
01:01:46,796 --> 01:01:50,976
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1133
01:01:57,516 --> 01:01:59,396
 When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessert just

1134
01:01:59,434 --> 01:02:00,814
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1135
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:01,982
Yeah.

1136
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:07,058
A letter from desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1137
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:09,478
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1138
01:02:09,528 --> 01:02:11,488
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1139
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,490
Your prenup?

1140
01:02:12,864 --> 01:02:15,824
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1141
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:17,657
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1142
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:23,659
I love you no matter what.

1143
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:25,078
But you need to tell me.

1144
01:02:25,126 --> 01:02:26,546
Tell you what?

1145
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:28,999
What are you asking me?

1146
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,760
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, go?

1147
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:36,299
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1148
01:02:36,346 --> 01:02:38,766
I would never ask you that!

1149
01:02:42,727 --> 01:02:43,727
Margo!

1150
01:02:56,533 --> 01:02:58,743
Don't walk on the glass.

1151
01:03:00,453 --> 01:03:03,083
You have no clue, do you?

1152
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:22,471
Why was he here that night?

1153
01:03:24,102 --> 01:03:26,942
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1154
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,900
Who cares?

1155
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,440
Rhonda, we got this.

1156
01:03:29,483 --> 01:03:30,983
Let's make the arrest.

1157
01:03:31,026 --> 01:03:33,116
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1158
01:03:33,153 --> 01:03:34,073
No.

1159
01:03:34,112 --> 01:03:36,282
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1160
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:39,203
So, I want one last thing.

1161
01:03:39,242 --> 01:03:40,072
What's that?

1162
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,160
I want a body.

1163
01:03:45,332 --> 01:03:49,752
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1164
01:03:49,794 --> 01:03:51,424
Be careful.

1165
01:03:55,967 --> 01:04:00,387
I need to be punished,
and by  punished,  I mean  had.

1166
01:04:04,935 --> 01:04:05,935
Fuck.

1167
01:04:07,896 --> 01:04:10,736
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

1168
01:04:11,983 --> 01:04:14,153
So, open the door...

1169
01:04:14,194 --> 01:04:15,574
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1170
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:18,112
...and look alive.

1171
01:04:21,243 --> 01:04:23,833
Punish. Wood.

1172
01:04:24,996 --> 01:04:26,586
Wood.

1173
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:01,417
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1174
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:03,869
And will love this baby.

1175
01:05:04,536 --> 01:05:08,166
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1176
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,500
But I could be wrong.

1177
01:05:16,673 --> 01:05:18,593
Because sometimes...

1178
01:05:19,593 --> 01:05:21,803
The way he looks at me...

1179
01:05:22,888 --> 01:05:24,638
I think...

1180
01:05:24,681 --> 01:05:25,761
Man of my dreams...

1181
01:05:27,684 --> 01:05:29,774
Father of my child...

1182
01:05:30,562 --> 01:05:34,562
This man of mine may kill me.

1183
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,942
He may truly...

1184
01:05:38,862 --> 01:05:39,612
Kill me.

1185
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:43,454
Wtf?

1186
01:06:08,517 --> 01:06:11,107
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1187
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:17,729
Technically,  missing.

1188
01:06:18,568 --> 01:06:20,228
Soon to be presumed dead.

1189
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:23,077
Gone.

1190
01:06:24,032 --> 01:06:27,282
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1191
01:06:27,327 --> 01:06:30,617
Will go to prison for my murder.

1192
01:06:31,915 --> 01:06:34,465
Nick dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1193
01:06:34,501 --> 01:06:37,001
And my hope and my money.

1194
01:06:37,045 --> 01:06:40,635
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1195
01:06:40,674 --> 01:06:42,094
That's murder.

1196
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:44,934
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1197
01:06:45,512 --> 01:06:48,512
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1198
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:55,727
You befriend a local idiot.

1199
01:06:59,276 --> 01:07:02,446
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1200
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:06,411
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1201
01:07:07,534 --> 01:07:09,834
Secretly create some money troubles.

1202
01:07:10,078 --> 01:07:13,248
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1203
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:18,086
With the help of the unwitting...

1204
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:20,128
Bump up your life insurance.

1205
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,010
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1206
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:28,341
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1207
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:33,435
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1208
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:36,447
And America loves pregnant women.

1209
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:39,771
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1210
01:07:39,816 --> 01:07:41,116
You know what's hard?

1211
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:43,570
Faking a pregnancy.

1212
01:07:43,612 --> 01:07:45,782
First, drain your toilet.

1213
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:50,241
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1214
01:07:50,285 --> 01:07:52,795
And ply her with lemonade.

1215
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:00,129
Steal pregnant idiot's urine.

1216
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:03,839
Voilà.

1217
01:08:03,882 --> 01:08:07,842
A pregnancy is now part
of your legal medical record.

1218
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:15,681
Happy anniversary.

1219
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:21,115
Wait for your clueless husband...

1220
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:23,019
To start his day.

1221
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:25,946
Off he goes.

1222
01:08:25,987 --> 01:08:28,147
And the clock is ticking.

1223
01:08:29,324 --> 01:08:31,824
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1224
01:08:32,494 --> 01:08:36,504
With just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1225
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:39,876
You need to bleed.

1226
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:40,920
A lot.

1227
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:43,507
A lot, a lot.

1228
01:08:46,842 --> 01:08:48,672
A head wound kind of bleed.

1229
01:08:49,344 --> 01:08:51,844
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,970
You need to clean poorly...

1231
01:08:57,018 --> 01:08:57,848
Like he would.

1232
01:08:58,728 --> 01:09:01,228
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1233
01:09:01,857 --> 01:09:04,447
And leave a little something behind.

1234
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,860
A fire in July?

1235
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:09,495
And because you're you...

1236
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:10,781
You don't stop there.

1237
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:13,409
You need a diary.

1238
01:09:13,451 --> 01:09:16,371
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1239
01:09:17,038 --> 01:09:19,328
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1240
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:21,674
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1241
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,710
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1242
01:09:24,045 --> 01:09:26,675
After that, you invent.

1243
01:09:26,715 --> 01:09:27,675
The spending.

1244
01:09:27,716 --> 01:09:29,516
The abuse. The fear.

1245
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:32,511
The threat of violence.

1246
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:34,514
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1247
01:09:35,223 --> 01:09:36,513
Burn it just the right amount.

1248
01:09:38,351 --> 01:09:40,231
Make sure the cops will find it.

1249
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:48,283
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1250
01:09:50,864 --> 01:09:53,664
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1251
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,410
For killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1252
01:09:56,453 --> 01:09:59,083
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1253
01:09:59,122 --> 01:10:01,082
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1254
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:03,674
And a pocket full of stones.

1255
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:06,500
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1256
01:10:06,546 --> 01:10:09,846
Nick dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1257
01:10:09,883 --> 01:10:12,223
And she floated down
past all the other...

1258
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,590
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1259
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:18,933
Then, Nick will die, too.

1260
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,680
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1261
01:10:21,728 --> 01:10:23,848
But, then, we never really existed.

1262
01:10:23,897 --> 01:10:27,117
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1263
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:27,900
 Cool girl.

1264
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:32,450
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1265
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:33,449
 She's a cool girl.

1266
01:10:34,616 --> 01:10:35,746
Cool girl is hot.

1267
01:10:35,784 --> 01:10:37,204
Cool girl is game.

1268
01:10:37,244 --> 01:10:38,164
Cool girl is fun.

1269
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:41,078
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1270
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:43,752
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1271
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:47,377
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1272
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,420
She likes what he likes.

1273
01:10:49,464 --> 01:10:52,924
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1274
01:10:53,969 --> 01:10:57,259
If he likes girls gone wild,
she's a mall babe...

1275
01:10:57,305 --> 01:11:01,105
Who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1276
01:11:01,143 --> 01:11:04,733
When I met Nick dunne,
I knew he wanted cool girl.

1277
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:07,441
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1278
01:11:07,482 --> 01:11:09,482
I wax stripped my pussy raw.

1279
01:11:10,152 --> 01:11:13,282
I drank canned beer
watching Adam sandler movies.

1280
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,320
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1281
01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:18,326
I blew him semi regularly.

1282
01:11:19,661 --> 01:11:20,991
I lived in the moment.

1283
01:11:21,288 --> 01:11:23,828
I was fucking game.

1284
01:11:24,457 --> 01:11:26,497
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1285
01:11:27,335 --> 01:11:30,635
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1286
01:11:30,672 --> 01:11:33,972
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1287
01:11:34,009 --> 01:11:36,929
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1288
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:40,600
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1289
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,390
I forged the man of my dreams.

1290
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,650
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1291
01:11:49,691 --> 01:11:51,521
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1292
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:56,153
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1293
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:59,033
But Nick got lazy.

1294
01:11:59,075 --> 01:12:01,285
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1295
01:12:01,328 --> 01:12:04,498
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1296
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:09,675
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1297
01:12:09,711 --> 01:12:13,671
And found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1298
01:12:13,715 --> 01:12:14,715
Cool girl.

1299
01:12:17,052 --> 01:12:21,222
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1300
01:12:21,723 --> 01:12:23,393
No fucking way.

1301
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:25,567
He doesn't get to win.

1302
01:12:35,904 --> 01:12:39,864
My cute, charming, salt of the earth,
Missouri guy.

1303
01:12:42,285 --> 01:12:44,745
He needed to learn.

1304
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:48,085
Grown ups work for things.

1305
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,585
Grown ups pay.

1306
01:12:51,962 --> 01:12:54,552
Grown ups suffer consequences.

1307
01:12:58,051 --> 01:12:59,261
Wait.

1308
01:12:59,636 --> 01:13:02,436
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1309
01:13:02,472 --> 01:13:04,102
Or get angry.

1310
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:07,099
Okay.

1311
01:13:11,064 --> 01:13:13,024
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1312
01:13:13,066 --> 01:13:16,236
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1313
01:13:16,278 --> 01:13:17,068
Wood.

1314
01:13:17,112 --> 01:13:20,242
 Woodshed.
 Yeah, my woodshed.

1315
01:13:20,282 --> 01:13:22,782
That fucking bitch.

1316
01:13:24,619 --> 01:13:25,949
 I thought  
 it's all right.

1317
01:13:25,996 --> 01:13:27,456
I would have, too.

1318
01:13:30,917 --> 01:13:32,117
What's that present?

1319
01:13:32,169 --> 01:13:33,919
I don't know.

1320
01:13:33,962 --> 01:13:35,922
Let's find out.

1321
01:13:42,512 --> 01:13:46,432
 Dear husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen.

1322
01:13:46,475 --> 01:13:47,895
 Don't believe that for a second.

1323
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:49,984
 I know where you've been,
and I know where you're going.

1324
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,480
 For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1325
01:13:55,525 --> 01:13:57,405
 Follow the river, up, up, up.

1326
01:13:57,444 --> 01:14:00,154
 Sit back and relax,
because you are done.

1327
01:14:00,197 --> 01:14:01,617
What's  up, up river ?

1328
01:14:01,656 --> 01:14:03,826
 Up the river.  Prison.

1329
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:05,787
Fucking crazy bitch.

1330
01:14:05,827 --> 01:14:07,447
That's what this is.

1331
01:14:07,496 --> 01:14:09,796
She's framing me for her murder.

1332
01:14:09,831 --> 01:14:11,121
You married a complete psychopath.

1333
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:13,296
The morning of our anniversary...

1334
01:14:13,335 --> 01:14:17,635
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1335
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:20,132
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1336
01:14:20,175 --> 01:14:21,095
Then what happened?

1337
01:14:21,134 --> 01:14:22,434
Before I could say anything, she said...

1338
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:25,849
 I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage.

1339
01:14:25,889 --> 01:14:27,139
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1340
01:14:27,182 --> 01:14:28,472
So you'd have no alibi.

1341
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:30,737
She stage managed me.

1342
01:14:31,019 --> 01:14:34,689
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1343
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:36,271
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1344
01:14:36,316 --> 01:14:38,026
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1345
01:14:38,068 --> 01:14:39,278
And by the time you got home

1346
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:40,859
she was gone.

1347
01:14:41,488 --> 01:14:42,358
You fuck!

1348
01:14:42,405 --> 01:14:43,995
She's good.

1349
01:14:44,991 --> 01:14:46,991
Part of me was relieved...

1350
01:14:47,035 --> 01:14:49,335
When I thought she was gone.

1351
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,418
Punch and Judy puppets.

1352
01:14:58,421 --> 01:15:01,511
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1353
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:02,670
So I'm punch.

1354
01:15:03,677 --> 01:15:05,687
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1355
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:09,687
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1356
01:15:36,585 --> 01:15:38,005
Hey, neighbor.

1357
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,300
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1358
01:15:41,923 --> 01:15:44,553
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1359
01:15:44,593 --> 01:15:47,723
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 am...

1360
01:15:47,762 --> 01:15:49,762
We're gonna be best friends.

1361
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:51,896
All right. Nice meeting you.

1362
01:15:51,933 --> 01:15:53,523
I'm greta.

1363
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:55,434
I'm Nancy.

1364
01:15:55,479 --> 01:15:57,439
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1365
01:15:57,481 --> 01:15:58,901
I'm sorry. I can't.

1366
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,150
I've got work to do.

1367
01:16:00,442 --> 01:16:02,482
All right. See you around!

1368
01:16:02,777 --> 01:16:04,687
You will.

1369
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:55,869
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1370
01:16:57,666 --> 01:16:59,546
You asshole.

1371
01:17:15,016 --> 01:17:16,526
Hey.

1372
01:17:19,312 --> 01:17:21,062
Nancy.

1373
01:17:23,358 --> 01:17:25,188
Nancy.

1374
01:17:26,194 --> 01:17:28,404
It's hot again today.

1375
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:32,529
So, where are you from?

1376
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:34,204
Let me guess.

1377
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:38,160
Nebraska.

1378
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:41,752
New Orleans.

1379
01:17:45,213 --> 01:17:47,713
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1380
01:17:47,757 --> 01:17:49,547
Oh, I just bet you are.

1381
01:17:49,593 --> 01:17:52,223
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1382
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:54,849
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1383
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,890
So sweet.

1384
01:17:57,726 --> 01:18:00,396
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1385
01:18:03,273 --> 01:18:05,693
I see we have the same taste in men.

1386
01:18:07,402 --> 01:18:09,652
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1387
01:18:09,696 --> 01:18:12,746
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1388
01:18:13,783 --> 01:18:15,163
Let me guess.

1389
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:19,082
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1390
01:18:19,372 --> 01:18:22,212
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1391
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,210
I got it.

1392
01:18:23,251 --> 01:18:25,711
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1393
01:18:25,754 --> 01:18:27,464
And he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1394
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:30,923
Worse.

1395
01:18:31,259 --> 01:18:32,259
Worse?

1396
01:18:33,094 --> 01:18:36,804
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1397
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:41,558
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1398
01:18:44,523 --> 01:18:46,523
On the very first night that we met...

1399
01:18:46,775 --> 01:18:50,945
We walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1400
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,160
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1401
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:56,489
A sugar storm.

1402
01:18:56,535 --> 01:18:58,665
And before he kissed me...

1403
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:00,793
He leaned in...

1404
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:04,580
And did this.

1405
01:19:15,262 --> 01:19:17,722
 And guess what.
 What?

1406
01:19:17,764 --> 01:19:19,474
He did the exact same thing with her.

1407
01:19:23,728 --> 01:19:26,728
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1408
01:19:26,773 --> 01:19:28,483
Thank you.

1409
01:19:43,248 --> 01:19:44,828
Thanks very much.

1410
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:53,921
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1411
01:20:09,524 --> 01:20:12,654
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1412
01:20:12,694 --> 01:20:14,824
Mr. bolt. Tanner bolt?

1413
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:18,108
Nick dunne.

1414
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:20,448
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1415
01:20:23,914 --> 01:20:25,164
I'm sorry.

1416
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:27,047
Do you not believe me?

1417
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:30,333
No, I believe you.
It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.

1418
01:20:30,378 --> 01:20:33,708
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1419
01:20:34,424 --> 01:20:37,724
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1420
01:20:37,761 --> 01:20:39,341
 Are you laughing me out of the building?
 No!

1421
01:20:39,387 --> 01:20:41,137
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1422
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:42,641
I'm way in.

1423
01:20:42,682 --> 01:20:45,312
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1424
01:20:45,352 --> 01:20:48,772
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1425
01:20:48,814 --> 01:20:50,484
$100,000?

1426
01:20:50,524 --> 01:20:52,064
We'll figure something out.

1427
01:20:52,108 --> 01:20:53,108
I'll give you a special...

1428
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:56,071
 My wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance  rate.

1429
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:57,152
Okay.

1430
01:20:57,197 --> 01:20:58,827
So, what's the plan?

1431
01:20:58,865 --> 01:21:00,745
Well, right now,
it's a  he said, she said.

1432
01:21:00,784 --> 01:21:03,244
 She's telling a better story.
 No, Nick.

1433
01:21:03,286 --> 01:21:05,126
She is telling the perfect story.

1434
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:08,713
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1435
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,130
 And if we decide to go with your version of  
 the truth.

1436
01:21:12,045 --> 01:21:15,385
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1437
01:21:15,423 --> 01:21:17,673
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1438
01:21:17,717 --> 01:21:21,047
And see her for what she is,
which a mind fucker of the first degree.

1439
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:25,431
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1440
01:21:25,475 --> 01:21:27,735
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1441
01:21:27,769 --> 01:21:30,849
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1442
01:21:30,897 --> 01:21:33,267
Eight years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1443
01:21:33,316 --> 01:21:35,486
That should be easy to find.

1444
01:21:36,027 --> 01:21:39,397
Ex classmate, desi collings.

1445
01:21:39,447 --> 01:21:41,027
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1446
01:21:42,617 --> 01:21:44,867
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1447
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:52,176
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1448
01:21:54,379 --> 01:21:55,589
Apparently.

1449
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,429
Tommy?

1450
01:22:06,475 --> 01:22:08,025
Yeah.

1451
01:22:08,435 --> 01:22:10,395
 Thanks for seeing me.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
01:22:13,482 --> 01:22:15,192
You're gonna want a drink.

1453
01:22:15,734 --> 01:22:17,074
Yeah.

1454
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:19,900
So, she said you got physical with her.

1455
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:22,916
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1456
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:25,319
First degree, felony rape.

1457
01:22:26,077 --> 01:22:27,787
 Did you do it?
 Did you do it?

1458
01:22:28,955 --> 01:22:31,045
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1459
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:33,123
 Did you get a trial?
 Fuck, no.

1460
01:22:33,168 --> 01:22:35,378
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1461
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:38,340
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1462
01:22:38,757 --> 01:22:40,427
 That's something.
 Oh, yeah.

1463
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:41,887
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1464
01:22:41,927 --> 01:22:44,437
Because I have to write  sexual offender 
on every job application.

1465
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:47,431
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1466
01:22:47,474 --> 01:22:50,814
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1467
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:54,691
Could you walk me through what happened?

1468
01:22:54,981 --> 01:22:58,111
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1469
01:22:58,151 --> 01:22:59,781
We click. She's perfect.

1470
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,150
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well read...

1471
01:23:02,197 --> 01:23:04,497
She's got an ass
like a 20 year old stripper.

1472
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:06,323
I think,  what's the catch?

1473
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,538
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1474
01:23:10,205 --> 01:23:13,255
Girls like a fixer upper, but Amy?

1475
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:16,751
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1476
01:23:16,795 --> 01:23:20,595
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1477
01:23:20,632 --> 01:23:22,842
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1478
01:23:22,884 --> 01:23:25,644
Ties. The whole thing just became

1479
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,469
 so, you broke up with her.
 No, I just backed away.

1480
01:23:29,516 --> 01:23:32,316
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1481
01:23:32,352 --> 01:23:34,022
So I thought.

1482
01:23:34,062 --> 01:23:36,352
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1483
01:23:36,398 --> 01:23:39,318
With a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1484
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:42,359
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1485
01:23:42,404 --> 01:23:43,994
And she is kneeling down, and

1486
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:46,030
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1487
01:23:46,074 --> 01:23:47,954
 You had sex?
 Yeah, consensual.

1488
01:23:47,993 --> 01:23:50,083
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1489
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:52,877
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1490
01:23:53,206 --> 01:23:56,126
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1491
01:23:56,168 --> 01:23:59,338
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1492
01:23:59,379 --> 01:24:03,049
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1493
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:04,551
Me!

1494
01:24:04,593 --> 01:24:06,343
And then, guess what they find.

1495
01:24:06,386 --> 01:24:08,436
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1496
01:24:08,847 --> 01:24:10,187
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1497
01:24:10,223 --> 01:24:11,563
You do know your wife.

1498
01:24:12,225 --> 01:24:14,065
 Did you ever see her again?
 Yeah.

1499
01:24:14,102 --> 01:24:15,522
On TV, last week, with you.

1500
01:24:16,104 --> 01:24:17,524
I thought,  there's Amy.

1501
01:24:17,564 --> 01:24:21,574
 She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered.

1502
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:26,575
You been watching this, too?

1503
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:27,825
Last night's bombshell.

1504
01:24:27,866 --> 01:24:28,916
We just found out...

1505
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,780
Amy elliott dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1506
01:24:32,287 --> 01:24:35,257
Kelly capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1507
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:38,250
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1508
01:24:38,293 --> 01:24:39,753
That turns men into animals?

1509
01:24:39,794 --> 01:24:41,294
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1510
01:24:41,588 --> 01:24:43,838
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1511
01:24:43,882 --> 01:24:46,262
Is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1512
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:49,181
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1513
01:24:49,221 --> 01:24:53,261
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
noelle hawthorne.

1514
01:24:53,308 --> 01:24:55,678
Thanks for being on the show, noelle.

1515
01:24:55,727 --> 01:24:57,017
Thank you, Ellen.

1516
01:24:57,062 --> 01:24:58,562
And let me just say this...

1517
01:24:58,605 --> 01:25:02,195
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1518
01:25:02,234 --> 01:25:03,274
Oh, that's nice.

1519
01:25:03,318 --> 01:25:05,438
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, noelle?

1520
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:08,037
Amy was so nurturing.

1521
01:25:08,073 --> 01:25:10,453
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1522
01:25:10,492 --> 01:25:11,782
 She was a real rag.

1523
01:25:14,287 --> 01:25:16,867
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1524
01:25:16,915 --> 01:25:18,965
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1525
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,630
What do you mean? People love her.

1526
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:24,090
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1527
01:25:25,799 --> 01:25:28,299
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1528
01:25:28,343 --> 01:25:29,553
Paid the ultimate price.

1529
01:25:29,594 --> 01:25:33,054
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1530
01:25:33,098 --> 01:25:34,718
He never introduced himself.

1531
01:25:34,766 --> 01:25:37,146
Why was that, noelle? Why do you think?

1532
01:25:37,185 --> 01:25:38,185
I think we know why.

1533
01:25:38,979 --> 01:25:41,229
Because he had a violent temper.

1534
01:25:41,273 --> 01:25:42,313
A little harsh.

1535
01:25:42,357 --> 01:25:43,937
That's life, baby.

1536
01:25:43,984 --> 01:25:45,274
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1537
01:25:46,486 --> 01:25:47,826
Don't get me wrong.

1538
01:25:47,863 --> 01:25:49,743
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1539
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:53,201
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1540
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,328
Fuck, yeah.

1541
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:58,791
She was so alone.

1542
01:25:58,832 --> 01:26:00,752
And she was so innocent.

1543
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:04,252
You're a good friend, noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1544
01:26:04,296 --> 01:26:05,506
Thanks for coming on.

1545
01:26:05,547 --> 01:26:07,007
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt.

1546
01:26:07,048 --> 01:26:09,338
Tanner bolt landed me.

1547
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:12,684
I'm gonna try and see desi collings
on my way home.

1548
01:26:12,721 --> 01:26:14,681
And, go...

1549
01:26:14,723 --> 01:26:17,893
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1550
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:19,811
That's just the retainer.

1551
01:26:20,187 --> 01:26:23,817
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an ira.

1552
01:26:23,857 --> 01:26:26,947
I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house.
We will go from there.

1553
01:26:26,985 --> 01:26:28,735
Thank you.

1554
01:26:29,488 --> 01:26:31,148
 I love you.
 I love you, too.

1555
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:33,948
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1556
01:26:33,992 --> 01:26:36,202
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1557
01:26:36,244 --> 01:26:37,204
Oh, fuck!

1558
01:26:37,245 --> 01:26:39,955
His twin sister, margo,
well, she is a peach.

1559
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:42,328
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1560
01:26:42,918 --> 01:26:45,038
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1561
01:26:45,086 --> 01:26:46,216
What the fuck?

1562
01:26:46,254 --> 01:26:48,924
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1563
01:26:49,424 --> 01:26:51,264
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1564
01:26:52,052 --> 01:26:54,182
They both seem very, very close.

1565
01:26:54,513 --> 01:26:55,763
It's twin cest.

1566
01:26:56,097 --> 01:26:58,807
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1567
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,850
And so, we close with a question.

1568
01:27:00,894 --> 01:27:02,394
What kind of moral rot...

1569
01:27:02,437 --> 01:27:07,147
Allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1570
01:27:07,192 --> 01:27:10,902
To vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1571
01:27:10,946 --> 01:27:11,996
Can I bum a cigarette?

1572
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:15,780
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1573
01:27:16,284 --> 01:27:18,494
And you know what else we won't forget?

1574
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:20,917
Missouri has the death penalty.

1575
01:27:20,956 --> 01:27:22,126
Amen.

1576
01:27:47,983 --> 01:27:50,273
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1577
01:27:50,318 --> 01:27:53,818
Near the woodshed
on the property of one margo dunne.

1578
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,490
Hey.

1579
01:28:42,037 --> 01:28:44,167
 Mr. dunne.
 Mr. collings.

1580
01:28:45,165 --> 01:28:48,255
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1581
01:28:48,293 --> 01:28:50,003
I wanted to help.

1582
01:28:50,795 --> 01:28:52,505
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1583
01:28:52,547 --> 01:28:55,627
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1584
01:28:56,510 --> 01:29:00,010
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter writing.

1585
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:03,895
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1586
01:29:04,559 --> 01:29:05,849
Everything.

1587
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:08,314
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1588
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:10,525
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1589
01:29:10,565 --> 01:29:13,365
 Why did you break up?
 That's a strange question.

1590
01:29:13,401 --> 01:29:15,361
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1591
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:16,613
That's a rude question.

1592
01:29:16,655 --> 01:29:18,365
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1593
01:29:18,406 --> 01:29:21,376
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1594
01:29:21,409 --> 01:29:23,489
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1595
01:29:23,537 --> 01:29:27,047
And you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1596
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:31,002
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1597
01:29:31,044 --> 01:29:33,254
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1598
01:29:36,925 --> 01:29:38,765
Mr. collings.

1599
01:29:40,846 --> 01:29:42,766
Fuck.

1600
01:29:48,395 --> 01:29:51,405
...the missing persons case
of Amy elliott dunne.

1601
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:55,109
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the amazing Amy kids' book series.

1602
01:30:12,294 --> 01:30:14,504
You're reading that diary again?

1603
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:15,596
You know how it ends.

1604
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:18,090
It interests me.

1605
01:30:18,133 --> 01:30:19,723
Hey, Rhonda.

1606
01:30:19,759 --> 01:30:21,679
 He's gonna kill me.  The end.

1607
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,840
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1608
01:30:23,889 --> 01:30:25,009
It's private. There's no one there.

1609
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:27,856
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1610
01:30:27,893 --> 01:30:30,853
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1611
01:30:30,896 --> 01:30:33,236
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1612
01:30:33,273 --> 01:30:35,363
Like finding an envelope marked  clue.

1613
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,520
You ever hear the expression...

1614
01:30:36,568 --> 01:30:38,318
 The simplest answer
is often the correct one ?

1615
01:30:39,112 --> 01:30:41,112
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1616
01:30:41,156 --> 01:30:42,956
 Good night.
 Good night.

1617
01:30:45,619 --> 01:30:46,619
Hey.

1618
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,957
Elvis is in Missouri.

1619
01:30:58,006 --> 01:31:00,136
Thank God. Come on in.

1620
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:02,595
First thing you have to understand about Amy,
she loves to teach lessons.

1621
01:31:03,178 --> 01:31:05,638
 Play God.
 Yeah, old testament God.

1622
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,720
Okay. Keep talking.

1623
01:31:06,765 --> 01:31:08,475
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1624
01:31:08,517 --> 01:31:10,107
Decides to teach me a lesson.

1625
01:31:10,143 --> 01:31:12,063
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1626
01:31:12,103 --> 01:31:14,313
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1627
01:31:14,356 --> 01:31:15,566
She does the treasure hunt.

1628
01:31:15,607 --> 01:31:16,947
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1629
01:31:16,983 --> 01:31:20,653
She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities.
Rubbing my nose in it.

1630
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:22,745
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1631
01:31:22,781 --> 01:31:24,491
Which will lead them
back to my office...

1632
01:31:24,533 --> 01:31:27,073
Which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1633
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:28,448
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1634
01:31:28,495 --> 01:31:29,665
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1635
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:31,414
 Clue two.
 My father's house.

1636
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,836
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1637
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:35,255
 Clue three?
 Woodshed.

1638
01:31:35,293 --> 01:31:36,793
 Also a location...
 Oh, my God.

1639
01:31:36,837 --> 01:31:38,597
 We had limited options.
 A hotel.

1640
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:41,130
 Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
 Put it on Andie's credit card.

1641
01:31:41,174 --> 01:31:42,514
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1642
01:31:42,551 --> 01:31:45,091
Nick, margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1643
01:31:45,137 --> 01:31:46,937
 This leads us to what?
 My dad's house.

1644
01:31:46,972 --> 01:31:48,722
Dad's house is blue.

1645
01:31:50,016 --> 01:31:53,066
After the divorce,
when dad wasn't coming around...

1646
01:31:53,395 --> 01:31:57,655
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. brown, who...

1647
01:31:57,691 --> 01:32:01,361
For the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1648
01:32:01,403 --> 01:32:02,823
You never told me that.

1649
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:04,861
You told her that?

1650
01:32:04,906 --> 01:32:07,206
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1651
01:32:07,534 --> 01:32:09,914
We've got a showcase showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1652
01:32:11,037 --> 01:32:14,367
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1653
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:15,506
And be honest.

1654
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,382
I honestly have no idea.

1655
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:28,261
Whatever they found,
I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.

1656
01:32:30,098 --> 01:32:32,348
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1657
01:32:32,601 --> 01:32:35,691
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1658
01:32:36,897 --> 01:32:38,697
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1659
01:32:38,732 --> 01:32:40,062
Okay. Amy's parents?

1660
01:32:40,108 --> 01:32:41,688
 No, it's...
 More pressure.

1661
01:32:41,735 --> 01:32:44,995
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1662
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:46,530
 No, Andie won't do that.
 She will.

1663
01:32:46,573 --> 01:32:48,283
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1664
01:32:48,783 --> 01:32:50,953
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1665
01:32:51,286 --> 01:32:53,586
 We need to tell the cops about Andie.
 Really?

1666
01:32:53,622 --> 01:32:55,792
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1667
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:57,795
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1668
01:32:58,084 --> 01:32:59,504
We need to be on the front end of that.

1669
01:32:59,544 --> 01:33:01,884
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1670
01:33:02,464 --> 01:33:03,674
They'll go after margo.

1671
01:33:03,715 --> 01:33:04,715
They can't do that, can they?

1672
01:33:04,758 --> 01:33:06,668
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1673
01:33:06,718 --> 01:33:08,798
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1674
01:33:09,721 --> 01:33:11,141
God.

1675
01:33:11,473 --> 01:33:13,563
Well, what are we going to do?

1676
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,470
We find Amy.

1677
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:17,233
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1678
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:19,600
I've got two ex secret service guys
that are really good.

1679
01:33:19,648 --> 01:33:21,268
I'll put them on it.

1680
01:33:21,316 --> 01:33:22,736
But where do they start, Nick?

1681
01:33:23,109 --> 01:33:24,229
Where would Amy go?

1682
01:33:26,404 --> 01:33:28,034
I have no idea.

1683
01:33:32,494 --> 01:33:35,124
Are we keeping score?

1684
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:37,159
Hey!

1685
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:41,962
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1686
01:33:42,003 --> 01:33:42,963
He's nice.

1687
01:33:43,004 --> 01:33:45,504
Because he wants to fuck you.

1688
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:48,674
She's still moping about her ex?

1689
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,140
He got cheated on, too.

1690
01:33:56,518 --> 01:33:59,388
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the ozarks.

1691
01:33:59,437 --> 01:34:00,977
I'm not sad.

1692
01:34:01,523 --> 01:34:02,483
I'm angry.

1693
01:34:02,524 --> 01:34:04,324
There you go.

1694
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:06,979
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1695
01:34:07,028 --> 01:34:09,278
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1696
01:34:09,322 --> 01:34:10,452
Don't give him the pleasure.

1697
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:13,620
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1698
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,160
Let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1699
01:34:16,204 --> 01:34:18,004
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.

1700
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:21,959
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1701
01:34:22,002 --> 01:34:24,462
Please put that on a t shirt.

1702
01:34:33,013 --> 01:34:35,393
Miss moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1703
01:34:36,892 --> 01:34:38,182
That's a fat wad.

1704
01:34:39,978 --> 01:34:41,768
It's mostly singles.

1705
01:34:41,813 --> 01:34:43,693
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1706
01:34:44,483 --> 01:34:47,073
Swamp girls, or treasure chest?

1707
01:34:48,195 --> 01:34:49,245
We're just teasing.

1708
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:51,820
Don't they tease people down in nola?

1709
01:34:54,242 --> 01:34:57,202
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest
any day now.

1710
01:34:57,245 --> 01:35:00,965
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1711
01:35:00,999 --> 01:35:04,959
And we have Amy elliott dunne,
missing for five days...

1712
01:35:05,003 --> 01:35:07,133
Crying out for justice.

1713
01:35:07,923 --> 01:35:09,633
We'll be right back.

1714
01:36:01,893 --> 01:36:04,483
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1715
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:05,311
Yeah?

1716
01:36:05,355 --> 01:36:06,945
You're doing Sharon schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1717
01:36:06,982 --> 01:36:07,982
It could go so wrong.

1718
01:36:08,024 --> 01:36:09,774
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1719
01:36:09,818 --> 01:36:11,108
Nope.

1720
01:36:11,153 --> 01:36:13,153
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1721
01:36:13,196 --> 01:36:15,286
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

1722
01:36:15,323 --> 01:36:19,033
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1723
01:36:19,077 --> 01:36:21,617
 People are gonna hate me.
 And then, they will forgive you.

1724
01:36:21,663 --> 01:36:24,123
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1725
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,836
People empathize with that.

1726
01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:29,172
 Why don't we just put out a statement?
 They need to see you.

1727
01:36:29,212 --> 01:36:32,302
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1728
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,840
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause

1729
01:36:34,885 --> 01:36:36,805
she's going to ask real questions.

1730
01:36:36,845 --> 01:36:38,685
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1731
01:36:38,722 --> 01:36:40,182
What to say, what not to say.

1732
01:36:40,223 --> 01:36:41,353
A trained monkey?

1733
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:43,431
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1734
01:36:44,769 --> 01:36:48,229
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1735
01:36:48,273 --> 01:36:50,023
They need to like you.

1736
01:36:50,066 --> 01:36:53,906
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1737
01:36:55,071 --> 01:36:57,571
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1738
01:37:07,042 --> 01:37:07,832
Hello?

1739
01:37:07,876 --> 01:37:09,086
Hey, baby.

1740
01:37:10,545 --> 01:37:12,135
One minute.

1741
01:37:20,889 --> 01:37:22,349
 Hey.
 Hey.

1742
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:23,350
You clearing out?

1743
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:25,221
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1744
01:37:25,268 --> 01:37:26,848
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1745
01:37:26,895 --> 01:37:27,945
I'll come by before

1746
01:37:27,979 --> 01:37:29,729
let us give you a hand.

1747
01:37:35,904 --> 01:37:38,364
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1748
01:37:40,033 --> 01:37:42,743
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1749
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:47,369
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1750
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,420
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1751
01:37:54,047 --> 01:37:55,047
A sock...

1752
01:37:55,966 --> 01:37:58,766
Or undies or what have you.

1753
01:38:03,598 --> 01:38:04,928
You did a real good job.

1754
01:38:06,935 --> 01:38:09,065
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1755
01:38:12,732 --> 01:38:13,482
Look under her dress.

1756
01:38:15,277 --> 01:38:16,537
He talked you into this?

1757
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:17,900
I talked him into it.

1758
01:38:17,946 --> 01:38:19,956
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1759
01:38:20,448 --> 01:38:24,118
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1760
01:38:24,161 --> 01:38:27,241
You say your name's Nancy,
but you don't even answer to it half the time.

1761
01:38:27,289 --> 01:38:29,749
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1762
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:31,831
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1763
01:38:32,169 --> 01:38:34,169
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1764
01:38:40,469 --> 01:38:42,469
Holy shit.

1765
01:38:45,515 --> 01:38:48,315
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1766
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:49,981
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1767
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,190
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1768
01:39:26,973 --> 01:39:28,603
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1769
01:39:56,211 --> 01:39:59,301
I did not kill my wife.

1770
01:40:00,298 --> 01:40:03,588
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1771
01:40:03,635 --> 01:40:04,725
I didn't kill my wife.

1772
01:40:06,555 --> 01:40:08,265
 What are you doing?
 Every time you look smug...

1773
01:40:08,306 --> 01:40:10,976
Or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1774
01:40:11,017 --> 01:40:12,977
 That's supposed to make me less tense?
 Let's try it again.

1775
01:40:13,019 --> 01:40:16,309
Mr. dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1776
01:40:17,357 --> 01:40:21,317
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1777
01:40:21,361 --> 01:40:22,361
You both did.

1778
01:40:25,073 --> 01:40:26,953
We both lost our jobs.

1779
01:40:26,992 --> 01:40:29,532
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1780
01:40:29,578 --> 01:40:32,118
Who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had

1781
01:40:32,164 --> 01:40:33,914
your dad's scorched earth.

1782
01:40:33,957 --> 01:40:35,627
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1783
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:36,827
Go on.

1784
01:40:36,877 --> 01:40:39,387
For a while,
things had been building up.

1785
01:40:39,421 --> 01:40:42,921
 Built up  implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1786
01:40:42,966 --> 01:40:45,386
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1787
01:40:46,219 --> 01:40:47,839
I had a moment of weakness.

1788
01:40:47,888 --> 01:40:50,298
Your  moment  was over 15 months.

1789
01:40:54,102 --> 01:40:56,192
I disrespected my wife.

1790
01:40:56,855 --> 01:40:59,275
And I disrespected my marriage.

1791
01:40:59,733 --> 01:41:01,113
And I'll always regret it.

1792
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:02,690
That works.

1793
01:41:02,736 --> 01:41:05,156
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1794
01:41:05,197 --> 01:41:06,907
 I was an idiot. I'm a fuck up.

1795
01:41:06,948 --> 01:41:07,778
 Everything I do is wrong.

1796
01:41:07,824 --> 01:41:09,874
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1797
01:41:11,995 --> 01:41:13,045
 Thank you.
 How do you feel?

1798
01:41:13,079 --> 01:41:16,289
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1799
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:19,328
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1800
01:41:19,377 --> 01:41:20,377
You hate that watch.

1801
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:22,500
No, go. I love that watch.

1802
01:41:22,547 --> 01:41:24,547
Just like I love this tie.

1803
01:41:24,591 --> 01:41:27,721
Just like I love my wife.

1804
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,463
It's you!

1805
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:01,501
It's you.

1806
01:42:02,337 --> 01:42:04,337
I'm sorry.

1807
01:42:05,006 --> 01:42:06,346
I'm sorry.

1808
01:42:07,259 --> 01:42:09,259
Good God.

1809
01:42:09,302 --> 01:42:10,682
Last week...

1810
01:42:11,179 --> 01:42:16,349
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1811
01:42:16,685 --> 01:42:18,855
So, I disappeared.

1812
01:42:20,021 --> 01:42:21,851
I lost the baby.

1813
01:42:22,357 --> 01:42:24,147
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1814
01:42:24,192 --> 01:42:28,112
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1815
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,034
Well, he is looking for you.

1816
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:32,659
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

1817
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:35,201
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1818
01:42:36,329 --> 01:42:37,539
You saved them.

1819
01:42:38,123 --> 01:42:39,163
Knowing you were out there...

1820
01:42:39,207 --> 01:42:41,827
Was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1821
01:42:41,877 --> 01:42:43,257
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1822
01:42:43,295 --> 01:42:44,595
No, I can't turn up now.

1823
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:47,709
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1824
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:51,841
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1825
01:42:51,887 --> 01:42:53,727
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1826
01:42:56,558 --> 01:42:59,018
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1827
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,060
It's utterly secluded.

1828
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:03,310
Why are you so good to me?

1829
01:43:03,356 --> 01:43:04,696
You know why.

1830
01:43:04,733 --> 01:43:05,863
Excuse me.

1831
01:43:05,901 --> 01:43:07,021
I know you, don't I?

1832
01:43:07,068 --> 01:43:07,858
No.

1833
01:43:07,903 --> 01:43:09,863
You're one of the nolan girls, right?

1834
01:43:09,905 --> 01:43:12,785
No, we're from winnipeg. Excuse us.

1835
01:43:12,824 --> 01:43:13,704
We should leave.

1836
01:43:13,742 --> 01:43:14,822
Just a second.

1837
01:43:15,410 --> 01:43:18,660
That was boney. I'll call her later.

1838
01:43:18,705 --> 01:43:20,585
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1839
01:43:20,874 --> 01:43:22,004
Sharon! Hi.

1840
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:23,712
Hope this is worth my while.

1841
01:43:23,752 --> 01:43:24,882
You're gonna be very happy.

1842
01:43:25,337 --> 01:43:26,137
Sharon.

1843
01:43:26,171 --> 01:43:28,381
Ms. schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1844
01:43:28,423 --> 01:43:30,553
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1845
01:43:30,592 --> 01:43:32,592
No, I had some gummy bears.

1846
01:43:33,678 --> 01:43:35,258
What the fuck?

1847
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:37,561
I'm sorry?

1848
01:43:37,974 --> 01:43:41,854
We have a major shocking development
in the amazing Amy disappearance.

1849
01:43:41,895 --> 01:43:43,275
We go live to that story now.

1850
01:43:43,313 --> 01:43:44,603
Oh, my God.

1851
01:43:46,775 --> 01:43:48,575
You little slut.

1852
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,610
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1853
01:43:52,614 --> 01:43:54,284
I met Nicholas dunne...

1854
01:43:54,324 --> 01:43:57,954
When he was my creative writing teacher
at mill valley.

1855
01:43:57,994 --> 01:44:00,084
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1856
01:44:00,121 --> 01:44:01,581
I am deeply ashamed...

1857
01:44:01,623 --> 01:44:04,753
Of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1858
01:44:04,793 --> 01:44:06,713
The girl with the giant cum on me tits.

1859
01:44:06,753 --> 01:44:08,753
I truly believed we were in love.

1860
01:44:08,797 --> 01:44:10,637
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

1861
01:44:12,134 --> 01:44:13,594
I know that is no excuse.

1862
01:44:13,635 --> 01:44:14,935
No, it is not.

1863
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:19,310
I do not, in my heart, believe
Nick dunne would have killed for me.

1864
01:44:19,349 --> 01:44:21,769
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1865
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:24,810
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1866
01:44:30,026 --> 01:44:31,986
We have loved Nick dunne like a son.

1867
01:44:32,821 --> 01:44:34,201
That love ended today.

1868
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:36,109
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1869
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:38,818
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1870
01:44:39,161 --> 01:44:41,081
We now absolutely believe...

1871
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:43,501
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1872
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:45,790
Our amazing Amy.

1873
01:44:46,668 --> 01:44:48,788
This just got very exciting.

1874
01:44:49,504 --> 01:44:51,214
We need a moment.

1875
01:44:53,216 --> 01:44:54,976
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1876
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:56,800
 Nothing has changed.
 Everything has changed.

1877
01:44:56,845 --> 01:44:59,265
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1878
01:44:59,306 --> 01:45:00,936
 I can handle this.
 We're on the defense.

1879
01:45:00,974 --> 01:45:03,024
This is a completely different dynamic.

1880
01:45:03,059 --> 01:45:05,809
 I can handle it.
 She's going to eat you alive.

1881
01:45:06,354 --> 01:45:08,024
Just trust me.

1882
01:45:12,402 --> 01:45:13,782
Okay.

1883
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:14,900
Great.

1884
01:45:15,739 --> 01:45:17,199
Mic him.

1885
01:45:36,927 --> 01:45:38,727
One, two, three, four, five.

1886
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:45,730
Thank you.

1887
01:45:47,229 --> 01:45:48,519
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1888
01:45:48,563 --> 01:45:49,563
Yeah, no kidding.

1889
01:45:54,236 --> 01:45:57,366
Roll tape. Five... four...

1890
01:45:57,405 --> 01:45:59,035
Three... two...

1891
01:46:01,243 --> 01:46:04,163
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1892
01:46:04,204 --> 01:46:05,664
 Amy brings out the best in me.
 Don't.

1893
01:46:05,705 --> 01:46:08,875
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1894
01:46:08,917 --> 01:46:11,337
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1895
01:46:11,378 --> 01:46:13,248
Andie was really good TV.

1896
01:46:13,296 --> 01:46:15,346
 She's a good person.
 Therein lies the problem.

1897
01:46:15,382 --> 01:46:16,382
Ride this out...

1898
01:46:16,424 --> 01:46:19,434
And when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1899
01:46:19,469 --> 01:46:21,049
But, until then...

1900
01:46:21,096 --> 01:46:23,056
Don't show your face.

1901
01:46:23,098 --> 01:46:24,928
No problem.

1902
01:46:41,241 --> 01:46:42,621
Welcome.

1903
01:46:44,619 --> 01:46:46,449
Make yourself at home.

1904
01:46:46,496 --> 01:46:50,466
I've got music, satellite...

1905
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,460
Netflix.

1906
01:46:51,501 --> 01:46:52,581
He was her teacher!

1907
01:46:52,627 --> 01:46:53,417
Roku.

1908
01:46:54,171 --> 01:46:56,671
Internet, obviously.

1909
01:46:57,257 --> 01:46:59,977
Here is a supposedly grown man

1910
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:03,800
if there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1911
01:47:03,847 --> 01:47:06,107
Just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1912
01:47:06,141 --> 01:47:09,271
Instead of the a b c's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1913
01:47:09,311 --> 01:47:12,231
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1914
01:47:12,272 --> 01:47:14,272
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1915
01:47:17,736 --> 01:47:19,116
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1916
01:47:19,154 --> 01:47:22,574
Not that I don't appreciate
bait shop chic.

1917
01:47:23,742 --> 01:47:26,242
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1918
01:47:26,286 --> 01:47:29,456
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1919
01:47:29,498 --> 01:47:31,828
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1920
01:47:33,668 --> 01:47:35,708
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1921
01:47:35,754 --> 01:47:37,294
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1922
01:47:37,339 --> 01:47:39,799
The bed is savoir.

1923
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:42,091
You'll never get a better sleep.

1924
01:47:45,972 --> 01:47:48,312
This is just what I need.

1925
01:47:49,768 --> 01:47:51,678
I'm so exhausted.

1926
01:47:53,188 --> 01:47:55,348
I'll leave you to it, then.

1927
01:47:57,108 --> 01:47:59,858
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1928
01:48:00,862 --> 01:48:03,992
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1929
01:48:04,032 --> 01:48:05,992
There are cameras everywhere.

1930
01:48:06,034 --> 01:48:08,914
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1931
01:48:08,954 --> 01:48:09,624
Anyone...

1932
01:48:10,121 --> 01:48:12,371
Who is caught coming or going...

1933
01:48:15,627 --> 01:48:17,217
Will be recorded.

1934
01:48:18,797 --> 01:48:21,517
You are more than safe.

1935
01:48:23,468 --> 01:48:26,968
And I am not letting you get away again.

1936
01:49:12,726 --> 01:49:14,316
 Good morning!
 Don't do that!

1937
01:49:16,062 --> 01:49:17,192
I'm sorry.

1938
01:49:19,191 --> 01:49:20,691
I need to feel safe.

1939
01:49:21,026 --> 01:49:24,036
You are very safe.

1940
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:27,859
 What have you been up to?
 Nothing.

1941
01:49:27,908 --> 01:49:30,618
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1942
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,660
It's hard for me.

1943
01:49:35,582 --> 01:49:39,212
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1944
01:49:41,463 --> 01:49:42,753
I know just what that feels like.

1945
01:49:43,673 --> 01:49:45,673
You were never under my thumb.

1946
01:49:46,259 --> 01:49:48,299
 On your leash.
 Never.

1947
01:49:48,345 --> 01:49:49,845
A new start.

1948
01:49:51,139 --> 01:49:52,759
Decent clothes.

1949
01:49:53,683 --> 01:49:55,933
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1950
01:49:56,228 --> 01:49:57,728
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1951
01:49:58,104 --> 01:50:01,654
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1952
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:04,821
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon schieber, and finally move on.

1953
01:50:04,861 --> 01:50:07,401
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1954
01:50:07,823 --> 01:50:09,533
Nonsense.

1955
01:50:13,161 --> 01:50:14,581
I'll be back.

1956
01:50:16,206 --> 01:50:18,376
And I am looking forward...

1957
01:50:18,416 --> 01:50:21,336
To my reunion with Amy elliott.

1958
01:50:44,526 --> 01:50:45,696
Great.

1959
01:50:46,736 --> 01:50:48,826
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.

1960
01:50:48,864 --> 01:50:50,494
 Tonight, exclusively...
 Hurry up.

1961
01:50:51,408 --> 01:50:55,788
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1962
01:50:55,829 --> 01:50:59,619
But on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1963
01:51:02,085 --> 01:51:03,635
Nick dunne...

1964
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:07,170
You're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1965
01:51:07,215 --> 01:51:09,805
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1966
01:51:09,843 --> 01:51:11,433
I bought that tie.

1967
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:13,510
Did you kill your wife, Nick?

1968
01:51:13,555 --> 01:51:16,645
I did not kill my wife.

1969
01:51:17,309 --> 01:51:18,849
I am not a murderer.

1970
01:51:18,894 --> 01:51:20,814
But you were unfaithful.

1971
01:51:20,854 --> 01:51:23,064
I was unfaithful.

1972
01:51:23,106 --> 01:51:24,776
And I am deeply ashamed.

1973
01:51:24,816 --> 01:51:27,156
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1974
01:51:27,444 --> 01:51:30,194
Her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1975
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:35,158
Believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1976
01:51:35,202 --> 01:51:37,082
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1977
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,120
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1978
01:51:40,165 --> 01:51:41,875
Now that we know you're a liar.

1979
01:51:42,167 --> 01:51:45,297
I didn't come forward with my affair...

1980
01:51:45,337 --> 01:51:48,507
Because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1981
01:51:49,341 --> 01:51:51,131
But I don't care about that anymore.

1982
01:51:51,176 --> 01:51:52,806
I just want to find my wife.

1983
01:51:52,844 --> 01:51:55,394
 I'm just trying to get clear  
 let me be clear.

1984
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:59,850
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1985
01:51:59,893 --> 01:52:01,063
I'm not a good guy.

1986
01:52:01,478 --> 01:52:03,938
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1987
01:52:04,314 --> 01:52:06,064
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1988
01:52:06,316 --> 01:52:08,866
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1989
01:52:09,194 --> 01:52:10,944
But what does that really mean to you?

1990
01:52:10,987 --> 01:52:13,027
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1991
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:17,200
I met Amy elliott seven years ago.

1992
01:52:17,244 --> 01:52:18,834
I was completely transfixed.

1993
01:52:19,287 --> 01:52:21,197
Amy can do that to you.

1994
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,788
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1995
01:52:23,834 --> 01:52:25,834
With mediocre aspirations.

1996
01:52:25,877 --> 01:52:28,377
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

1997
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:30,381
And I wanted her to love me...

1998
01:52:30,423 --> 01:52:32,763
So I pretended to be better than I was.

1999
01:52:33,635 --> 01:52:37,305
When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.

2000
01:52:37,347 --> 01:52:39,177
That guy who works harder.

2001
01:52:39,224 --> 01:52:41,434
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2002
01:52:41,476 --> 01:52:44,396
And loves with as much passion
as she does.

2003
01:52:44,646 --> 01:52:45,856
But I failed her.

2004
01:52:46,773 --> 01:52:47,903
Instead of doing what was right...

2005
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:50,571
I did what was easy.

2006
01:52:51,319 --> 01:52:54,949
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2007
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:56,610
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2008
01:52:56,658 --> 01:52:57,948
She is still alive.

2009
01:52:59,828 --> 01:53:02,658
Will you look at that camera for me?

2010
01:53:02,998 --> 01:53:05,958
Will you look in the lens...

2011
01:53:06,001 --> 01:53:07,961
And talk to your wife?

2012
01:53:08,003 --> 01:53:11,093
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2013
01:53:11,131 --> 01:53:13,801
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2014
01:53:17,345 --> 01:53:19,645
Amy, I love you.

2015
01:53:20,348 --> 01:53:23,138
You're the best person I've ever known.

2016
01:53:23,185 --> 01:53:27,655
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2017
01:53:27,689 --> 01:53:29,649
And if you come back, I promise...

2018
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:32,191
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2019
01:53:32,694 --> 01:53:36,534
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2020
01:53:39,117 --> 01:53:40,117
I love you.

2021
01:53:41,036 --> 01:53:42,626
Come home.

2022
01:53:47,375 --> 01:53:48,375
Here.

2023
01:53:54,508 --> 01:53:56,128
Regardless of what you thought...

2024
01:53:56,176 --> 01:53:58,346
What does it say?

2025
01:53:58,386 --> 01:53:59,936
...I think we can all agree...

2026
01:53:59,971 --> 01:54:01,471
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2027
01:54:01,515 --> 01:54:02,685
...there's more to him
than meets the eye.

2028
01:54:02,724 --> 01:54:03,814
They're going crazy for you.

2029
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:08,350
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2030
01:54:08,396 --> 01:54:10,026
And now they love me.

2031
01:54:10,065 --> 01:54:13,025
...a candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2032
01:54:13,068 --> 01:54:14,978
He's certainly earned mine.

2033
01:54:15,821 --> 01:54:16,901
What is it?

2034
01:54:19,741 --> 01:54:22,911
I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.

2035
01:54:27,833 --> 01:54:30,623
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2036
01:54:30,669 --> 01:54:32,879
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2037
01:54:32,921 --> 01:54:37,511
But a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2038
01:54:37,926 --> 01:54:38,886
Call Tanner.

2039
01:54:38,927 --> 01:54:40,097
Okay. Fuck!

2040
01:54:44,224 --> 01:54:45,684
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2041
01:54:46,935 --> 01:54:47,775
Is that what this is about?

2042
01:54:49,437 --> 01:54:54,187
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2043
01:54:54,234 --> 01:54:56,534
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2044
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:58,070
Every time you said something stupid...

2045
01:54:58,113 --> 01:55:00,493
I thought,  maybe he's just stupid.

2046
01:55:00,532 --> 01:55:03,072
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2047
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:04,238
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2048
01:55:04,286 --> 01:55:05,086
None of that is mine.

2049
01:55:05,579 --> 01:55:07,159
None of this was put here by me.

2050
01:55:07,205 --> 01:55:10,755
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2051
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:13,922
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2052
01:55:13,962 --> 01:55:15,042
Nick!

2053
01:55:16,298 --> 01:55:19,218
 You can't do that!
 Of course we can.

2054
01:55:27,517 --> 01:55:30,097
Amy, it's time to move on.

2055
01:55:30,145 --> 01:55:31,855
What can I do to help?

2056
01:55:32,564 --> 01:55:34,114
I need some time to think.

2057
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:36,649
 That's the last thing you need.
 Desi

2058
01:55:36,693 --> 01:55:39,283
twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

2059
01:55:39,321 --> 01:55:42,991
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2060
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,030
Follow that instinct.

2061
01:55:45,076 --> 01:55:47,496
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2062
01:55:48,038 --> 01:55:51,208
Sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2063
01:55:54,544 --> 01:55:57,254
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2064
01:55:59,674 --> 01:56:02,344
I understand what you're saying, desi.

2065
01:56:03,595 --> 01:56:05,225
I do.

2066
01:56:08,558 --> 01:56:10,558
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2067
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:16,110
I've forgotten how to behave.

2068
01:56:21,863 --> 01:56:24,163
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2069
01:56:24,199 --> 01:56:26,779
And we'll work it out together.

2070
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:32,580
I just want you to be you again.

2071
01:56:40,423 --> 01:56:41,923
They only took margo to fuck with you.

2072
01:56:41,967 --> 01:56:43,677
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2073
01:56:43,718 --> 01:56:46,468
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2074
01:56:47,139 --> 01:56:48,889
What?

2075
01:56:50,892 --> 01:56:52,522
We tell boney very little.

2076
01:56:52,561 --> 01:56:54,691
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2077
01:56:54,729 --> 01:56:57,019
Their only hope is a confession.

2078
01:56:57,065 --> 01:56:59,025
So, you let them do all the talking.

2079
01:56:59,067 --> 01:57:01,187
That way,
we can jump start your defense.

2080
01:57:01,236 --> 01:57:03,616
The truth is my defense.

2081
01:57:09,578 --> 01:57:10,528
Recognize these?

2082
01:57:10,579 --> 01:57:12,699
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2083
01:57:12,747 --> 01:57:14,537
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2084
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:17,083
Mommy, daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2085
01:57:17,586 --> 01:57:18,756
No.

2086
01:57:20,005 --> 01:57:21,755
 Recognize this?
 Never seen that before in my life.

2087
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:25,590
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2088
01:57:27,596 --> 01:57:28,896
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2089
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:30,930
 He's not a handwriting ex  
 looks like it.

2090
01:57:30,974 --> 01:57:32,104
Our experts thought so, too.

2091
01:57:33,435 --> 01:57:35,145
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2092
01:57:35,896 --> 01:57:37,106
Sure.

2093
01:57:37,147 --> 01:57:41,617
 And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me.

2094
01:57:42,736 --> 01:57:44,746
Yeah, that's true.

2095
01:57:45,989 --> 01:57:47,989
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2096
01:57:49,284 --> 01:57:50,624
That is also true, yes.

2097
01:57:52,787 --> 01:57:54,907
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2098
01:57:54,956 --> 01:57:56,966
I hit her? No, never happened.

2099
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,620
  Pushed,  it says  pushed. 
 Absolutely not.

2100
01:57:58,668 --> 01:57:59,748
I never touched her.

2101
01:58:02,172 --> 01:58:03,802
She tried to buy a gun.

2102
01:58:04,466 --> 01:58:06,346
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2103
01:58:07,761 --> 01:58:09,391
Shall I read the last entry?

2104
01:58:09,429 --> 01:58:10,469
Sure.

2105
01:58:11,765 --> 01:58:13,895
 This man may kill me.

2106
01:58:13,934 --> 01:58:16,144
In her own words,
 this man may kill me.

2107
01:58:16,186 --> 01:58:18,316
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2108
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:26,240
For future reference...

2109
01:58:26,279 --> 01:58:28,609
The truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2110
01:58:28,657 --> 01:58:29,707
Okay, I know.

2111
01:58:38,124 --> 01:58:39,964
Judy's missing handle.

2112
01:58:41,503 --> 01:58:43,793
Big as a two by four, right?
Big as a club.

2113
01:58:43,839 --> 01:58:46,589
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2114
01:58:46,633 --> 01:58:49,303
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2115
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,184
We bagged it.

2116
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:51,340
I've never seen that before either.

2117
01:58:51,388 --> 01:58:54,008
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2118
01:58:54,057 --> 01:58:56,267
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...

2119
01:58:56,309 --> 01:58:57,929
You're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2120
01:58:57,978 --> 01:58:59,188
Do not say another word.

2121
01:58:59,229 --> 01:59:00,559
 What about my side?
 Nick!

2122
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:15,370
More coffee?

2123
01:59:15,412 --> 01:59:17,202
I'd love it.

2124
01:59:19,499 --> 01:59:23,129
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the cape?

2125
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:25,710
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2126
01:59:25,755 --> 01:59:27,385
This reminds me of that.

2127
01:59:27,883 --> 01:59:29,553
Never ending holiday.

2128
01:59:31,094 --> 01:59:33,304
You're not bored?

2129
01:59:33,346 --> 01:59:34,856
Desi, how could I be bored?

2130
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:37,350
You can discuss
18th century symphonies...

2131
01:59:37,392 --> 01:59:40,312
19th century impressionists,
quote proust in French.

2132
01:59:40,687 --> 01:59:44,807
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2133
01:59:44,858 --> 01:59:46,728
With one hand down his boxers.

2134
01:59:48,737 --> 01:59:50,327
I really have to get going.

2135
01:59:50,655 --> 01:59:53,995
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2136
02:00:00,582 --> 02:00:01,662
My keys.

2137
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,880
Thank you.

2138
02:00:20,101 --> 02:00:21,681
That's how the kids wear it.

2139
02:01:22,497 --> 02:01:26,327
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2140
02:01:29,171 --> 02:01:30,341
Hey.

2141
02:01:30,755 --> 02:01:33,135
 Are you okay?
 Yes. Are you?

2142
02:01:33,175 --> 02:01:34,425
Yeah.

2143
02:01:34,468 --> 02:01:36,338
Let's go.

2144
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,390
What does this mean?

2145
02:01:39,431 --> 02:01:41,601
Well, you're out on bond.

2146
02:01:41,641 --> 02:01:44,851
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2147
02:01:50,358 --> 02:01:52,358
Keep your head down.

2148
02:02:07,792 --> 02:02:10,172
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2149
02:02:10,212 --> 02:02:12,212
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2150
02:02:12,714 --> 02:02:14,344
She's air.

2151
02:02:16,384 --> 02:02:19,344
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2152
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:19,110
Mr. collings is home.

2153
02:03:19,156 --> 02:03:21,536
Hello, Mr. collings.

2154
02:03:21,575 --> 02:03:23,455
I've missed you.

2155
02:03:23,493 --> 02:03:25,123
I've been thinking...

2156
02:03:25,579 --> 02:03:27,749
I don't wanna be without you.

2157
02:03:28,456 --> 02:03:30,796
Stay with me.

2158
02:03:30,834 --> 02:03:33,794
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2159
02:03:33,837 --> 02:03:36,137
Octopus and scrabble?

2160
02:03:38,133 --> 02:03:40,383
How long do you think until it's done?

2161
02:03:40,427 --> 02:03:44,017
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2162
02:03:44,514 --> 02:03:45,604
He'll appeal.

2163
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,770
I can watch the rest overseas.

2164
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,450
Go slowly.

2165
02:04:06,495 --> 02:04:07,375
But I want it.

2166
02:04:27,849 --> 02:04:29,429
Don't rush.

2167
02:04:29,476 --> 02:04:31,566
Just do it.

2168
02:04:40,028 --> 02:04:41,568
Harder.

2169
02:06:20,128 --> 02:06:23,298
You fucking bitch.

2170
02:06:31,973 --> 02:06:35,643
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2171
02:06:37,270 --> 02:06:40,770
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2172
02:06:40,816 --> 02:06:41,946
We'll make sure it's a match.

2173
02:06:41,983 --> 02:06:43,733
Yeah, it'll match.

2174
02:06:43,777 --> 02:06:46,247
Thank you very much.

2175
02:06:46,279 --> 02:06:47,779
What do you think?

2176
02:06:47,823 --> 02:06:49,113
Are we pals again?

2177
02:06:49,157 --> 02:06:52,697
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2178
02:06:52,744 --> 02:06:53,704
What do you think?

2179
02:06:53,745 --> 02:06:56,665
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2180
02:06:58,834 --> 02:07:01,294
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2181
02:07:01,336 --> 02:07:03,256
It's okay. I want to help.

2182
02:07:03,296 --> 02:07:04,716
Ms. dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2183
02:07:04,756 --> 02:07:07,096
So we'll keep this very brief.

2184
02:07:07,134 --> 02:07:09,514
Can you walk us through what happened?

2185
02:07:12,139 --> 02:07:14,759
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2186
02:07:15,642 --> 02:07:17,642
So normal.

2187
02:07:17,686 --> 02:07:19,526
I opened the door.

2188
02:07:20,147 --> 02:07:21,987
So strange.

2189
02:07:22,607 --> 02:07:26,227
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2190
02:07:26,278 --> 02:07:29,358
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2191
02:07:29,406 --> 02:07:31,036
Answer his letters.

2192
02:07:31,283 --> 02:07:33,283
Keep him calm.

2193
02:07:34,703 --> 02:07:36,163
Oh, my God.

2194
02:07:36,788 --> 02:07:38,408
I've encouraged him.

2195
02:07:38,456 --> 02:07:40,256
You can't blame yourself.

2196
02:07:41,877 --> 02:07:44,047
He pushed inside.

2197
02:07:45,630 --> 02:07:47,670
And he grabbed me.

2198
02:07:48,383 --> 02:07:51,473
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2199
02:07:51,803 --> 02:07:53,513
And he clubbed me.

2200
02:07:53,972 --> 02:07:55,392
I collapsed.

2201
02:07:55,432 --> 02:07:59,482
That club was actually the handle
to a punch and Judy puppet.

2202
02:07:59,519 --> 02:08:00,939
Right.

2203
02:08:01,855 --> 02:08:03,275
Treasure hunt.

2204
02:08:05,192 --> 02:08:07,232
I'd hidden some puppets at go's

2205
02:08:07,277 --> 02:08:08,997
then how did desi have that handle?

2206
02:08:10,864 --> 02:08:12,784
I'd just found it.

2207
02:08:13,533 --> 02:08:15,953
It must have fallen off.

2208
02:08:17,871 --> 02:08:21,541
I was holding it when desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2209
02:08:21,583 --> 02:08:22,793
About that woodshed...

2210
02:08:22,834 --> 02:08:24,504
He took me to his lake house.

2211
02:08:25,086 --> 02:08:26,796
Tied me to his bed.

2212
02:08:26,838 --> 02:08:29,378
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2213
02:08:29,424 --> 02:08:31,264
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2214
02:08:31,301 --> 02:08:32,681
Did you notice that it was packed

2215
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:33,879
lots of stuff.

2216
02:08:33,929 --> 02:08:38,349
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2217
02:08:38,391 --> 02:08:39,891
Nick and credit cards.

2218
02:08:39,935 --> 02:08:42,485
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2219
02:08:42,521 --> 02:08:45,311
He hid a lot of stuff at go's.
They're very close.

2220
02:08:45,857 --> 02:08:50,187
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2221
02:08:50,237 --> 02:08:52,997
By a man with a history
of mental problems?

2222
02:08:53,031 --> 02:08:53,901
Please continue, Ms. dunne.

2223
02:08:58,411 --> 02:09:00,491
Desi assaulted me that night.

2224
02:09:01,456 --> 02:09:03,296
Every night.

2225
02:09:04,417 --> 02:09:06,827
He tied me up like a dog.

2226
02:09:08,213 --> 02:09:10,713
And then, he'd punish me.

2227
02:09:12,634 --> 02:09:14,684
Starve me.

2228
02:09:15,971 --> 02:09:17,891
Shave me.

2229
02:09:19,516 --> 02:09:21,476
Sodomize me.

2230
02:09:22,269 --> 02:09:24,099
There were cameras everywhere.

2231
02:09:24,146 --> 02:09:27,106
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2232
02:09:28,775 --> 02:09:31,985
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2233
02:09:33,071 --> 02:09:35,281
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2234
02:09:35,323 --> 02:09:37,913
If he had her tied up the whole time?

2235
02:09:38,869 --> 02:09:40,909
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2236
02:09:41,705 --> 02:09:43,665
Amy, we found your diary.

2237
02:09:43,707 --> 02:09:47,797
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2238
02:09:47,836 --> 02:09:50,716
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2239
02:09:51,548 --> 02:09:53,048
Nick didn't want a baby.

2240
02:09:54,885 --> 02:09:58,185
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2241
02:09:59,097 --> 02:10:00,217
But I love him.

2242
02:10:00,265 --> 02:10:02,015
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2243
02:10:03,977 --> 02:10:06,057
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2244
02:10:06,104 --> 02:10:07,944
If I could just clarify one thing

2245
02:10:07,981 --> 02:10:11,191
if this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2246
02:10:11,234 --> 02:10:13,114
My husband would be on death row...

2247
02:10:13,403 --> 02:10:17,153
And I'd be tied, still, spread eagle...

2248
02:10:17,449 --> 02:10:21,119
Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2249
02:10:21,995 --> 02:10:24,165
Now, I have to ask you...

2250
02:10:24,206 --> 02:10:27,046
Do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2251
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:42,101
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2252
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,510
Amy dunne is home.

2253
02:10:43,558 --> 02:10:45,638
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2254
02:10:45,685 --> 02:10:47,695
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2255
02:10:47,729 --> 02:10:52,649
And just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2256
02:11:00,116 --> 02:11:01,916
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2257
02:11:53,670 --> 02:11:54,880
We love you, Amy!

2258
02:11:59,509 --> 02:12:01,339
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2259
02:12:01,386 --> 02:12:03,056
I'm not pretending.

2260
02:12:03,763 --> 02:12:05,473
You were perfect.

2261
02:12:06,099 --> 02:12:08,639
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2262
02:12:08,685 --> 02:12:11,395
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2263
02:12:11,438 --> 02:12:13,268
That's how well you know me.

2264
02:12:13,315 --> 02:12:15,945
You know me in your marrow.

2265
02:12:16,943 --> 02:12:18,533
Okay.

2266
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:21,900
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2267
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:24,450
Take off your clothes.

2268
02:12:24,951 --> 02:12:28,161
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2269
02:12:41,468 --> 02:12:45,468
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2270
02:12:45,514 --> 02:12:47,104
I'm a fighter.

2271
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,600
I fought my way back to you.

2272
02:12:49,643 --> 02:12:51,483
You killed a guy.

2273
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,480
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2274
02:12:53,522 --> 02:12:58,192
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2275
02:12:58,777 --> 02:13:00,037
And I obliged.

2276
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:01,530
But I want that Nick.

2277
02:13:01,863 --> 02:13:03,283
I'm leaving.

2278
02:13:03,323 --> 02:13:05,953
You really think that's smart?

2279
02:13:06,618 --> 02:13:07,578
Shampoo.

2280
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:14,250
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2281
02:13:14,292 --> 02:13:16,172
And he deserts her.

2282
02:13:16,211 --> 02:13:17,251
They'll destroy you.

2283
02:13:18,004 --> 02:13:19,504
Neighbors will shun you.

2284
02:13:19,548 --> 02:13:23,758
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2285
02:13:25,846 --> 02:13:30,936
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2286
02:13:31,518 --> 02:13:33,138
Once they go...

2287
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:34,940
I go.

2288
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:38,400
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2289
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:56,830
Was there ever a baby?

2290
02:13:57,127 --> 02:13:59,217
There can be.

2291
02:14:03,216 --> 02:14:04,226
Good night.

2292
02:14:57,145 --> 02:14:58,815
Hey, Nick!

2293
02:15:10,951 --> 02:15:12,201
Hello, handsome.

2294
02:15:15,330 --> 02:15:17,080
Crepe?

2295
02:15:17,791 --> 02:15:18,711
Sure.

2296
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:20,460
She was his dream girl.

2297
02:15:20,502 --> 02:15:23,922
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2298
02:15:23,964 --> 02:15:25,344
He took her.

2299
02:15:32,722 --> 02:15:34,062
You must be so proud.

2300
02:15:41,314 --> 02:15:43,314
It's been four hours.

2301
02:15:43,817 --> 02:15:46,657
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2302
02:15:50,824 --> 02:15:53,664
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2303
02:15:54,494 --> 02:15:58,004
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2304
02:15:58,039 --> 02:16:00,459
That's the real tragedy.

2305
02:16:04,212 --> 02:16:06,252
Kiss my cheek.

2306
02:16:12,596 --> 02:16:15,396
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2307
02:16:15,432 --> 02:16:17,642
She told me she killed desi.

2308
02:16:17,684 --> 02:16:19,024
Not self defense. Murder.

2309
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:20,600
 Can't we get a wire?
 That's not gonna work.

2310
02:16:20,645 --> 02:16:21,815
She told you once before.

2311
02:16:21,855 --> 02:16:24,195
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2312
02:16:24,232 --> 02:16:27,482
I swear, you two are the most
fucked up people I've ever known.

2313
02:16:27,527 --> 02:16:28,987
And I specialize in fucked up.

2314
02:16:29,237 --> 02:16:31,067
You and Amy under the same roof?

2315
02:16:31,114 --> 02:16:32,914
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2316
02:16:33,533 --> 02:16:35,913
Amy dunne,
and the miracle on the Mississippi.

2317
02:16:35,952 --> 02:16:38,452
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2318
02:16:38,497 --> 02:16:39,837
We've had our dark days.

2319
02:16:39,873 --> 02:16:41,713
But we thank you so much...

2320
02:16:42,209 --> 02:16:46,749
For supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2321
02:16:47,005 --> 02:16:50,725
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2322
02:16:50,759 --> 02:16:52,169
She's good.

2323
02:16:52,219 --> 02:16:54,799
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband.

2324
02:16:54,846 --> 02:16:56,936
The real housewives of branson.

2325
02:16:56,973 --> 02:16:58,063
Take care of this guy, will you?

2326
02:16:58,099 --> 02:16:59,469
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2327
02:16:59,726 --> 02:17:01,276
You are not at risk anymore.

2328
02:17:01,311 --> 02:17:02,851
I'm the definition of  at risk.

2329
02:17:02,896 --> 02:17:07,026
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,
you franchised the bar.

2330
02:17:07,067 --> 02:17:08,117
You may wanna thank her.

2331
02:17:11,154 --> 02:17:12,574
Just don't piss her off.

2332
02:17:13,406 --> 02:17:14,166
See you, guys.

2333
02:17:16,535 --> 02:17:18,205
Elvis has left Missouri.

2334
02:17:18,245 --> 02:17:19,335
She had to have made a mistake.

2335
02:17:19,371 --> 02:17:21,661
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2336
02:17:21,706 --> 02:17:23,586
Nick, I can't do anything.

2337
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,830
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2338
02:17:26,878 --> 02:17:28,588
The case is with the feds now,
they're done.

2339
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:29,670
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2340
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:31,880
It does.

2341
02:18:03,456 --> 02:18:04,916
What are you doing?

2342
02:18:06,835 --> 02:18:08,425
Couldn't sleep.

2343
02:18:08,461 --> 02:18:09,131
Come on...

2344
02:18:09,754 --> 02:18:11,924
Let me tuck you back in.

2345
02:18:24,603 --> 02:18:27,233
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2346
02:18:29,316 --> 02:18:31,406
Yeah, it's just...

2347
02:18:31,443 --> 02:18:32,943
I need more time.

2348
02:18:32,986 --> 02:18:36,536
I would never, ever hurt you.

2349
02:18:38,325 --> 02:18:40,785
I do need you to participate, though.

2350
02:18:40,827 --> 02:18:42,987
I need you to do your part.

2351
02:18:53,298 --> 02:18:54,048
Okay.

2352
02:18:55,050 --> 02:18:57,880
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2353
02:18:57,928 --> 02:18:59,298
Is a lie.

2354
02:18:59,346 --> 02:19:03,436
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2355
02:19:04,059 --> 02:19:05,599
And I have been complicit

2356
02:19:05,644 --> 02:19:06,774
Nick!

2357
02:19:12,442 --> 02:19:14,612
Nick? Breakfast.

2358
02:19:14,653 --> 02:19:15,483
Honey?

2359
02:19:19,199 --> 02:19:21,659
We should hold hands.

2360
02:19:21,701 --> 02:19:24,791
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2361
02:19:26,206 --> 02:19:28,416
 So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?

2362
02:19:31,044 --> 02:19:32,924
 It's fantastic.

2363
02:19:32,963 --> 02:19:36,013
 How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?

2364
02:19:36,049 --> 02:19:37,759
 Fantastic  is a little flippant.

2365
02:19:38,176 --> 02:19:39,306
 Amazing ?

2366
02:19:39,344 --> 02:19:42,184
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2367
02:19:42,222 --> 02:19:45,222
And that you hid all that stuff at go's
and that you pushed me.

2368
02:19:45,976 --> 02:19:49,026
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2369
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:52,060
You have to own this, Nick.

2370
02:19:52,858 --> 02:19:56,398
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2371
02:19:57,988 --> 02:19:59,738
Nick.

2372
02:20:02,701 --> 02:20:05,331
What a beautiful home.

2373
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:09,250
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2374
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:11,461
You went on national television...

2375
02:20:11,501 --> 02:20:13,961
And told people that I murdered my wife.

2376
02:20:14,004 --> 02:20:15,254
I go where the story goes.

2377
02:20:15,297 --> 02:20:18,267
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2378
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:21,840
I didn't use the  I  word.
I said you two were  extremely close.

2379
02:20:21,887 --> 02:20:26,567
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2380
02:20:27,767 --> 02:20:29,517
Ice breaker.

2381
02:20:33,231 --> 02:20:35,021
To go with your robot dog.

2382
02:20:35,066 --> 02:20:37,116
I'll go find Amy.

2383
02:20:39,154 --> 02:20:41,244
She's downstairs.

2384
02:20:43,742 --> 02:20:45,372
 What is it?
 It's for you.

2385
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:46,830
Open it.

2386
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:48,870
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2387
02:20:48,914 --> 02:20:50,624
Open it.

2388
02:21:03,178 --> 02:21:04,838
I didn't touch you.

2389
02:21:04,888 --> 02:21:05,928
You didn't need to.

2390
02:21:05,972 --> 02:21:09,182
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2391
02:21:09,226 --> 02:21:10,736
I have that. You threw it out.

2392
02:21:10,769 --> 02:21:12,599
The notice, yes.

2393
02:21:12,979 --> 02:21:13,849
I want a blood test.

2394
02:21:14,397 --> 02:21:15,477
I want a paternity test.

2395
02:21:16,274 --> 02:21:17,614
I love tests.

2396
02:21:17,651 --> 02:21:19,481
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2397
02:21:19,528 --> 02:21:22,238
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2398
02:21:24,366 --> 02:21:27,076
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2399
02:21:27,118 --> 02:21:29,488
He'll do that all by himself.

2400
02:21:29,538 --> 02:21:31,408
You fucking cunt!

2401
02:21:33,291 --> 02:21:35,671
I'm the cunt you married.

2402
02:21:35,710 --> 02:21:37,500
The only time you liked yourself...

2403
02:21:37,546 --> 02:21:41,216
Was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2404
02:21:41,258 --> 02:21:44,718
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2405
02:21:48,473 --> 02:21:51,723
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2406
02:21:52,978 --> 02:21:55,518
You think you would be happy
with a nice midwestern girl?

2407
02:21:55,564 --> 02:21:58,404
No way, baby. I'm it.

2408
02:21:58,441 --> 02:22:01,861
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2409
02:22:01,903 --> 02:22:03,403
Why would you even want this?

2410
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,860
Yes, I loved you.

2411
02:22:04,906 --> 02:22:08,376
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2412
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:09,410
And cause each other pain.

2413
02:22:09,953 --> 02:22:11,743
That's marriage.

2414
02:22:14,416 --> 02:22:16,796
Now, I'm getting ready.

2415
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:45,190
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2416
02:22:45,238 --> 02:22:46,898
I can't just walk away.

2417
02:22:46,948 --> 02:22:48,528
You could get custody.

2418
02:22:48,575 --> 02:22:52,455
No, I won't. And you know it.

2419
02:22:52,496 --> 02:22:55,006
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2420
02:22:55,624 --> 02:22:57,424
You wanna stay.

2421
02:22:57,459 --> 02:23:01,379
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2422
02:23:01,421 --> 02:23:02,671
You wanna stay with her.

2423
02:23:13,308 --> 02:23:14,348
You're breaking my heart.

2424
02:23:14,810 --> 02:23:18,440
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2425
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:20,980
I need you with me on this.

2426
02:23:21,024 --> 02:23:23,484
Of course I'm with you.

2427
02:23:26,112 --> 02:23:30,112
I was with you before we were even born.

2428
02:23:31,868 --> 02:23:34,658
We've been through the darkness.

2429
02:23:35,205 --> 02:23:38,505
We've come out, united.

2430
02:23:41,503 --> 02:23:43,673
We communicate.

2431
02:23:45,966 --> 02:23:48,476
We're honest with each other.

2432
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:50,010
Right?

2433
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:54,430
We're partners in crime.

2434
02:23:57,811 --> 02:23:58,641
And?

2435
02:24:00,522 --> 02:24:01,852
And?

2436
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:07,280
We're gonna be parents.

2437
02:24:08,989 --> 02:24:10,609
My goodness!

2438
02:24:11,032 --> 02:24:12,992
 How exciting!
 Thank you...

2439
02:24:18,321 --> 02:24:21,791
 What are you thinking?

2440
02:24:23,535 --> 02:24:25,745
 How are you feeling?

2441
02:24:27,706 --> 02:24:30,336
 What have we done to each other?

2442
02:24:31,918 --> 02:24:34,808
 What will we do?

2443
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:40,600
Thank you for using subs
     regards, shock...
